In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

Nowadays the company is far behind its rivals. Would a supercar make any difference? One must admit that this carmaker had some high quality and sporty models like 9-3 Viggen and Sonett but what could really bring them back on the scene with the world class automakers? It’s simple, a supercar, to be precise, one called AiroX . New Gray Design concept got us thinking because it shows AI (artificial intelligence) built into the car aside from jet-inspired, futuristic looks.\nHowever, we should take this with a grain of salt. Real chances of Saab making a supercar are really small. As the company is managed by the ‘ National Electric Vehicle Sweden ’ which puts all its focus on breathing life into the 9-3 electric model, there is not much space for a supercar project. In addition to that, the company stated in January this year that China’s ‘Panda New Energy’ ordered 15,000 electric vehicles which imply that the production of those should start at least before the end of 2017. Unfortunately, that leaves no room for a supercar, maybe it could be one of the future projects.\n68\nSHARES\n')[0m

The Toronto Zoo says attendance is up for the first time in several years, which it attributes to a baby animal boom and good weather. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young\nTORONTO — The Toronto Zoo is citing a baby animal boom as one of the main reasons for its first attendance increase in several years.\nIn an annual review presented to its board, the city-owned facility said more than 1.3 million people visited the zoo in 2016, an increase of nearly 170,000 people compared to those who came to the zoo the previous year.\n\"It was a very good year,\" said zoo spokeswoman Jennifer Tracey.\nAttendance had been declining at the zoo since 2013, when the facility had seen a boost due to the arrival of two pandas from China.\nFor 2016, the zoo cited several cubs — two pandas, four white lions and a polar bear — along with a rhinoceros calf as among main reasons for its attendance bump.\nThe new panda cubs, named Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue, even drew Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other politicians for a cuddle session at the zoo last spring.\nAccording to results of the zoo\'s 2016 on-site visitor survey, 37.7 per cent of respondents said they visited the facility because of the panda exhibit, 31 per cent said they went explicitly to see the panda cubs and a further 17 per cent said baby animals in general drew them there. The remaining respondents said they visited the zoo for other attractions.\nBabies weren\'t the only reason for the boost in attendance.\n\"The weather is also a huge factor,\" Tracey said. \"We had great fall weather.\"\nThe zoo had its third-highest October attendance since it opened in 1974 when 93,145 people visited, according to the report. And the following month was its best November on record when 46,638 came out.\nTracey said a hot, dry summer also had an impact.\n\"Rain, or even the threat of rain will make people change their plans for the day,\" she said.\nAs it plans for the year ahead, the zoo noted that many of its popular baby animals are leaving the facility after growing up.\nThe panda cubs, as well as the adult pandas, are scheduled to leave for the Calgary Zoo in March 2018, the white lion cubs have already left for a park in Quebec and Juno, the now-large polar bear, just left for Winnipeg\'s Assiniboine Park on Wednesday, Tracey said.\nSo the zoo is looking at the possibility of more babies.\n\"I am hopeful that there will be success with conservation breeding programs this year,\" Tracey said.\nShe also touted the upcoming opening of its \"Wildlife Health Centre\" that is scheduled to open some time this spring.\n\"There will be a public viewing area into some of the labs where they can see our reproductive technologists at work, x-rays, surgical suites and where they run a lot of the lab work,\" Tracey said.\nThe 2016 attendance boost led to increased revenues at the zoo, Tracey said, but the facility still needed a City of Toronto subsidy to balance the books.\nBy Liam Casey, The Canadian Press\n')[0m

Now, when someone goes on working trips, they better bring back some good business. So, this is the same for the Ministers. Don\'t just go there for holiday, better bring back China investments to Singapore. Just like what Malaysia and Philippine leaders achieved when they visited China. Your pay are many times higher than theirs. Time to work hard.\nAL Goh\n4 Responses to \"Sending younger ministers to China to build relationships?\"\nJim:\nYoung pigs send to the lion den to taste real life and be slaughtered as a sacrificial piglet\nGD Star Rating\nloading...\nLIONS:\nwell,vb FUMBLED YET AGAIN,he remained so quiet.\n\nwe need a more well-received FM to improve our image with the outside world.\nbtw,TEO CHEE HEAN\'S ANCESTORS from OCBC linkage had good ties with CHINA n OCBC OPERATES IN CHINA for many years.\nso,seems the right bloke to send to appease the angry PANDA.\nTHEY BETTER SALVAGE THE RELATIONSHIP or we all kena marked???\n')[0m

Possibly. It\'s hard to think of another local restaurant where you can order an egg foo yung burrito, pair a chile relleno with your pork fried rice, or get a rice bowl topped with both Sonoran machaca and Chinese barbecue.\nThe Mex-Chinese (with a dash of Caribbean flavor) restaurant debuted in 1990 in north Phoenix, a sort of forerunner to the kind of modern fusion cooking you now find at places like SumoMaya or the Clever Koi. Chino Bandido doesn\'t so much fuse distinct cuisines together, though - more like plops them side-by-side in the same aluminum bowl.\nThe restaurant has been around long enough to achieve cult-classic status in metro Phoenix. It\'s the restaurant equivalent of that quirky indie movie you love fiercely and remember fondly, but which might not be recommended for a mass audience, or perhaps doesn\'t have the same impact on a second viewing.\nStill, there is something eternal about eating at Chino Bandido, a feeling that\'s kind of evoked in the restaurant\'s tagline - \"Eat at Chinos, Live Forever!\"\nThe restaurant\'s mascot, a panda bear with a Pancho Villa-inspired canana (cartridge belt) slung across its chest, wearing a big sombrero and holding chopsticks, seems so curiously retro and cheesy, it feels about ready to be embraced as a local icon. You can picture the logo splashed across the front of some Phoenix hipster\'s faded vintage-style T-shirt.\nThe veggie quesadilla at Chino Bandido was decidedly underwhelming.\nJackie Mercandetti\nThe strip-mall restaurant itself is shabby yet appealing. The restaurant\'s lobby, decked out with black-and-white checkered floors and a \"Wall of Chino\" covered in plaques and award certificates bearing dates from nearly 20 years ago, seems untouched by time. You get the feeling that some of the friendly people working the counter have been there about that long, too.\nIf you grew up in north Phoenix, the bare-bones dining room, which has been expanded over the years to seat more than 100 guests on workaday folding tables, probably holds as many memories as any scrapbook.\nFor first-timers, the Chino Bandido menu - printed on long, white order forms with instructions and checkboxes - might seem about as complicated and indecipherable as somebody\'s medical chart. It\'s full of obscure acronyms - the JFR stands for jerk fried rice - and painfully obvious menu descriptions: Quesadillas, in case you haven\'t figured it out yet, are \"folded cheese crisps.\"\nOne of the best things about eating at Chino Bandido is simply figuring out the ordering system. The combos and configurations are almost endless, and you can get as weird with your order as you wish. You can order some Mexican-style carnitas, served over Jamaican jerk fried rice, with a cheese quesadilla on the side. Nobody will bat an eye.\nYou probably love the food at Chino Bandido\'s more than I do. On a recent visit, my combo bowl was a cheese-laden muddle of bland refried beans, under-seasoned pork fried rice, and an egg foo yung that was so devoid of flavor, it might have doubled as a waterlogged dishrag.\nAn order of the T.J. Veggie quesadilla was not much more than a soggy flour tortilla, half-heartedly sprinkled with a little cheese and crammed with cold iceberg lettuce and veggies.\nThe real allure comes with the proteins, unapologetically made in the vein of American Chinese fast food - things like the Jade Red chicken, Chinese barbecue pork, or Hengrenade chicken. You can sample the various meats before locking in your order at the counter.\nOne of the best items at Chino Bandido is the complimentary snickerdoodle cookie.\nJackie Mercandetti\nOn a recent visit, the Jade Red chicken yielded soft, fleshy bundles of meat, draped in a goopy, sodium-rich sauce. The Chinese barbecue pork had a sort of earthy richness, like a loose, vaguely sweet mole sauce.\nThe chewy texture of the meat, though, and the unnaturally goopy flavorings, may siphon away some of the joy of eating at Chino Bandido.\nThe most perfect thing I\'ve ever eaten at Chino Bandido, as it happens, is not something smothered in an orange-reddish sauce. It\'s the complimentary house snickerdoodle cookie that comes with your meal. It\'s a light, sugary confection that seems like an odd way to wind down dinner, until you remember that you are at Chino Bandido, where anything goes.\nIf Chino Bandido doesn\'t satisfy your yen for Chinese takeout, another unusual spot for old-school American Chinese food is Chop and Wok, a fraying-around-the-edges, rock \'n\' roll-themed haunt near Shea Boulevard and Scottsdale Road.\nEXPAND\nThe potstickers at Chop and Wok.\n')[0m

Living up to the company\'s motto of \"good games have no borders\", lead developers of NetEase\'s five flagship games shared development concepts and behind-the-scene stories with an audience of gamers, industry peers, and reporters. The successful event was a direct reflection of the popularity and traction that NetEase Games has in overseas markets.\nThe Insight of Fun forum focused on NetEase Games\' core value - committed pursuit of the highest quality games and player experience. The company\'s mission is for gamers, developers and others who are involved in the gaming ecosystem to explore and enjoy the fun of games. Going forward, NetEase Games will host regular events in overseas markets to share development experience with industry peers and to explore the globalized future of gaming.\n\"Quality games have no borders. At NetEase, it is our sincere hope to create more high quality and innovative products for gamers around the world,\" said Ethan Wang , V ice President of NetEase, Inc.\nAttendees also got a preview of NetEase Games\' global product plan. \"This Spring, we will be launching a deep and immersive 3D-action MMORPG,\" said Riten Huang , General Manager of NetEase Games. \"Following that, we are excited to bring the popular game, Onmyoji, to audiences in the West. Later in 2017, we also plan to launch a strategy and exploration MMO game created by an international team of developers, including top industry talent s from China , the United States , Germany and South Korea .\"\nRobust financial and operational performance in China forms a solid foundation for NetEase\'s overseas expansion. In 2016, revenues of NetEase\'s online gaming segment reached $4 billion , up 61.6% year over year. NetEase Games continues to maintain high growth rate and deliver new hit games. After consolidating its market leadership in China , NetEase Games is looking to expand further overseas. When discussing the overseas strategy for NetEase Games, NetEase CEO Ding Lei mentioned that he has ambitious goals to achieve greater results in the non-Chinese gaming markets within the next three to five years.\nTo show their dedication toward overseas markets, NetEase sent its dream team of lead developers for five flagship games to the event. This group consisted of Chen Junxiong of the mobile version of the NetEase classic Fantasy Westward Journey, Jin Tao of 2016 blockbuster Onmyoji, Yu Kai of the company\'s first virtual reality game Twilight Pioneers, Liu Xi of the mobile game adaptation of Hollywood animation film Kung Fu Panda 3, and Wang Xi of the upcoming 3D warfare MMO War Rage.\nThese five developers represent NetEase Games\' flagship titles and the highest quality of production that the company intends to bring to overseas markets. Early indications of global expansion have been very encouraging - Fantasy Westward Journey has over 100 million registered players worldwide; Twilight Pioneers was selected as among the first wave of releases on Google\'s virtual reality platform Daydream; Kung Fu Panda 3 was rated Google Play 2016 Top 10 Games in Korea; the Japanese version of Onmyoji was released last week and was number on the free download rankings. Unlike the others, however, War Rage was designed for overseas markets from the ground up.\nBy harnessing its industry leading game development capabilities and unique insight into fun, NetEase will propel its global expansion by introducing Chinese games to global markets, working with partners to publish titles in China , and create games developed from the ground up tailored to international audiences. Many exciting changes are ahead, but what remains is the company\'s commitment to creating the best games for players in China and around the world.\nAbout NetEase\nNetEase, Inc . i s a leading internet technology company in China .

The Arnold Sports Festival and Fitness Expo kicks off today.\nAn estimated 200,000 fitness enthusiasts, athletes, sports fans and spectators are expected to flock Downtown to the annual event named after one of the world\'s best-known bodybuilders, Arnold Schwarzenegger. \nHere are eight things you need to know to get ready for the big weekend:\n 1. What is it?\nThe Arnold Sports Festival is the largest multi-sport festival in the nation — even bigger than the Olympics — with about 20,000 athletes from 80 nations competing in 70 sports and events. The Expo will feature more than 1,000 booths of the latest in sports equipment, apparel and nutrition among competition stages. Most events are Friday-Sunday at the Greater Columbus Convention Center and the Ohio Expo Center.\n2. When did it start?\nSchwarzenegger and sports promoter Jim Lorimer have co-produced the U.S. festival in Columbus since 1989, when it debuted as a one-day bodybuilding competition known as the Arnold Classic. They now host multi-sport festivals on five other continents: Australia, South America, Africa, Asia and Europe.\n3. How much does it cost?\nA daily Expo ticket is $15 in advance and $20 at the door, which offers admission into the Arnold Fitness Expo and most other events. A three-day ticket is $40 in advance. Children 14 and under are free with an adult. Buy tickets and admission to other special events at ticketmaster.com/arnold.\n4. How do I get there?\nFree shuttles will connect every Downtown hotel to the Greater Columbus Convention Center for most of the weekend. A shuttle from there heads to the Ohio Expo Center. (View a shuttle map and schedule.) The Columbus Commons parking garages should have spaces available and guests can reserve other parking spots online ahead of time through Parking Panda.\n5. What\'s new?\nNew events in 2017 include lacrosse, disabled power-lifting, yoga classes and competitions, handball, the Arnold Pro Strongwoman, Indoor Scottish Highland Games and the Arnold Transformation Challenge. That\'s in addition to the iconic bodybuilding competitions and sporting events and everything in-between.\n6. Is it kid-friendly?\nChildren are encouraged to come to the Ohio Expo Center\'s Bricker Building for the Arnold Sports World Kids & Teens Expo on Saturday and Sunday. It\'s a smorgasbord of interactive sport demonstrations and activities with more than 200 vendors, zip-lining and a stage with nonstop entertainment.\n7. Will Arnold be there?\nOf course! Though it\'s possible to spot Schwarzenegger maneuvering through throngs of people throughout the weekend (just look for the swarming fans) he\'ll make some public appearances to present awards and take photos, too. His Sunday showcase from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Batelle Grand is the only opportunity to engage with him in an open forum. Tickets cost $25.\n8. Where can I learn more?\nCheck Dispatch.com all weekend for coverage of competitions, athlete profiles and feature stories about new events. Visit arnoldsportsfestival.com and follow the Arnold on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n')[0m

(Oct. 13) \n\nAttendance had been declining since 2013, when the zoo had seen a boost due to the arrival of two pandas from China.\nTracey says a warm fall, a dry summer and a moderate spring also helped the numbers for 2016.\nShe says the attendance bump led to increased revenues\n')[0m

Last month, a roulette player from the UK had a €565,034 a winning streak at the Roulette Professional Series table. Before him, Royal Panda Casino announced the big live blackjack win of 30-year-old Michael from the Netherlands.\nMichael was playing at the Exclusive Royal Panda Live Blackjack VIP table, betting up to €5,000 per one hand. Such high bets insist that Michael is a high roller who’s confident in his blackjack strategy. Following a streak of big winning hands, Michael left the table with €71,250. What’s more, he also collected plenty of Royal Panda Casino loyalty points.\nThe popular UK gambling site has a slightly different loyalty reward-system than most casinos. The points you collect can be exchanged for bonuses as well as gifts such as gadgets, including iPad, iPhones, and MacBooks. A €50 bet on live blackjack translates to 1 loyalty point, so Michael probably finished his session with hundreds of loyalty points.\nScore the next big live blackjack win\nIf you’d like to score a similarly big live blackjack win, take a seat at one of Royal Panda Casino’s live blackjack tables. There are two exclusive ones, Live Blackjack VIP and Live Blackjack. Furthermore, there are two classic titles, Blackjack Classic and Blackjack Party.

However, the girl decided to move out the relationship after coming to know that the actor was married. While Anupam reportedly assured the complainant to marry her after divorcing his wife, the latter was in no mood to mend the ties and go ahead with it.\nFollowing the breakup, the duped girl then distanced herself from Panda which he couldn’t take it. Enraged over this, he allegedly circulated their intimate photographs on social networking site and sent it to her family members. Besides, he also allegedly intimidated her.\nFollowing this, the girl studying MBA in a city-based institution filed a complaint with the local police station here leading to his arrest.\nNotably, Anupam Panda had played the lead character in ‘Flashback’ released in December 2015.\nThe regional entertainment industry has been embroiled in various controversies including casting couch and involvement in chit fund scam.\n')[0m

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young\nTORONTO — The Toronto Zoo says attendance is up for the first time in several years, which it attributes to a baby animal boom and good weather.\nThe park says more than 1.3 million people visited the zoo in 2016, an increase of nearly 170,000 people compared to those who came to the zoo the previous year.\nZoo spokeswoman Jennifer Tracey says the births of two pandas, four white lion cubs and a rhinoceros calf are the main reasons for the attendance bump.\nAttendance had been declining since 2013, when the zoo had seen a boost due to the arrival of two pandas from China.\nTracey says a warm fall, a dry summer and a moderate spring also helped the numbers for 2016.\nShe says the attendance bump led to increased revenues.\nBy The Canadian Press\n')[0m

Televisione Streaming / Flickr\nWhat is your style of winding down after a particularly difficult day at work? Some of us might choose to head down to the local watering hole and have a pint or two while exchanging banter with our mates. Others prefer to just sit down, kick back their shoes and relax on their favorite sofa while turning the TV on. There are so many things to watch on TV these days, where do you start? Well, we can tell you one thing -- you would not go too far wrong if you are a Netflix customer. March madness is coming your way, and in a good manner too -- there are new Netflix movies and TV shows to enjoy. Without much further ado, here are the details on what is in store for the month of March on Netflix.\n\nIron Fist and The Discovery\n The two heavyweights that will make u p the bulk of Netflix originals would be Iron Fist and The Discovery for the month of March. The maiden season of the Marvel series Iron Fist will make its debut this coming March 17, where it will be yet another Marvel character who have made the transition to the small screen such as Daredevil, Jessica Jones and Luke Cage . Expect The Defenders to arrive once the entire Iron Fist series is shown, as that would then bring together all of the superheroes into the same team -- a budget Avengers, if you will.\n\nAs for The Discovery, this happens to be a brand new Netflix original movie that will see Jason Segel, Rooney Mara and Robert Redford star. The Discovery is titled that way, as it will concentrate on the discovery (duh!) of an afterlife, which eventually translates to millions of suicides as well as dealing with the fallout that happens after that.\n\nThere are also other noteworthy original titles from Netflix that will arrive this month, including the first season of 13 Reasons Why, the second season of Love, the second season of Grace and Frankie, as well as the Amy Schumer comedy special that is aptly titled, Amy Schumer: The Leather Special.\n\nHere are the titles that are available since March 1, 2017:\n\nAngry Birds: Season 2 (2013)\n Blazing Saddles (1974)\n Chicago (2002)\n Deep Run (2015)\n Dirt Every Day: Season 1 (2013)\n Epic Drives: Season 2 (2015)\n Friday After Next (2002)\n Head 2 Head: Season 2 (2013)\n Hot Rod Unlimited: Season 1 (2013)\n Ignition: Season 1 (2013)\n Impossible Dreamers (2017)\n Jurassic Park (1993)\n Jurassic Park III (2001)\n Kate and Mim-Mim: Season 2 (2015)\n Know Your Enemy – Japan (1945)\n Kung Fu Panda (2008)\n Let There Be Light (1946)\n Memento (2000)\n Midnight in Paris (2011)\n Nacho Libre (2006)\n Nazi Concentration Camps (1945)\n Roadkill: Season 2 (2013)\n Rolling Stones: Crossfire Hurricane (2012)\n San Pietro (1945)\n Singing with angels (2016)\n Sustainable (2016)\n Slums of Beverly Hills (1998)\n The Craft (1996)\n This Is Spinal Tap (1984)\n Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny (2006)\n The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)\n The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress (1944)\n The Negro Soldier (1944)\n Thunderbolt (1947)\n Tunisian Victory (1944)\n\nMarch 3, 2017\n Greenleaf: Season 1 (2016)\n\nMarch 4, 2017\n Safe Haven (2013)\n\nMarch 5, 2017\n Señora Acero: Season 3 (2016)\n\nMarch 7, 2017\n Amy Schumer: The Leather Special-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\nMarch 8, 2017\n Hands of Stone (2016)\n The Waterboy (1998)\n\nMarch 9, 2017\n Thithi (2015)\n\nMarch 10, 2017\n Buddy Thunderstruck: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Burning Sands-NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n Love: Season 2-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n One More Time: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n The Boss\' Daughter (2016)\n\nMarch 13, 2017\n Must Love Dogs (2005)\n Million Dollar Baby (2004)\n\nMarch 14, 2017\n Disney\'s Pete\'s Dragon (2016)\n Jim Norton: Mouthful of Shame-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\nMarch 15, 2017\n Disney\'s The BFG (2016)\n Notes on Blindness (2016)\n\nMarch 16, 2017\n Beau Sejour: Season 1 –NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Coraline (2009)\n\nMarch 17\n Deidra & Laney Rob a Train-NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n Julie\'s Greenroom: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Marvel\'s Iron Fist: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Naledi: A Baby Elephant\'s Tale (2016)\n Pandora-NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n Samurai Gourmet: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\nMarch 18, 2017\n Come and Find Me (2016)\n The Vampire Diaries: Season 8 (2016)\n\nMarch 20, 2017\n El Reemplazante: Season 1-2 (2012)\n\nMarch 21, 2017\n Ali & Nino (2016)\n Another Forever (2016)\n Evolution (2015)\n Fire at the Sea (Fuocoammare) (2016)\n\nMarch 23, 2017\n How to Get Away with Murder: Season 3 (2016)\n Welcome to New York (2015)\n\nMarch 24, 2017\n Bottersnikes & Gumbles: Season 2-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Déjà Vu (2006)\n Felipe Neto: My Life Makes No Sense-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Grace and Frankie: Season 3-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Ingobernable: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Spider (2007)\n The Square (2008)\n The Most Hated Woman in America-NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)\n\nMarch 25, 2017\n The Student Body (2017)\n USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage (2016)\n\nMarch 26, 2017\n The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004)\n\nMarch 27, 2017\n Better Call Saul: Season 2\n\nMarch 28, 2017\n Archer: Season 7 (2016)\n Jo Koy: Live from Seattle-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\nMarch 30, 2017\n Life in Pieces: Season 1 (2015)\n\nMarch 31, 2017\n 13 Reasons Why: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Bordertown: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Cooper Barrett\'s Guide to Surviving Life: Season 1 (2016)\n Dinotrux: Season 4-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n FirstBorn (2016)\n Five Came Back-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n GLOW: The Story of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (2012)\n Rosewood: Season 1\n The Carmichael Show: Season 1-2\n The Discovery-NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n Trailer Park Boys: Season 11-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\n')[0m

McKinney started working for Two Sigma, the huge quant hedge fund with around $40bn under management, in August 2016. He\'s best known, however, in the world of open source programming.\nAn MIT math graduate, McKinney began his finance career at hedge fund AQR Capital Management in 2007. Three years later, he quit to do a PhD at Duke. Since then, he\'s been steeped in the world of Python data analytics tools, including Datapad, a visual analytics system he sold in 2014, and the open source Pandas Python data analysis library,  which is nine years old this April.\n\"Open source is the future of how a lot of our software will get built,\" said McKinney, speaking at a Newsweek conference on artificial intelligence and data science in London today. However, because open source software is typically developed by engineers working on unpaid side projects, he said many open source initiatives are unsustainable and can absorb all engineers\' free time. Open source programmers, \"have lives and families,\" said McKinney, adding that he personally has started limiting his involvement for this reason. \"I personally feel that if my open source work isn\'t being sponsored, I ought to focus on things that can pay my rent.\"\nMcKinney didn\'t say so, but this might be why he joined Two Sigma, which pays an average of $417k to each of its staff in London.  Two Sigma, along with rival quant fund Man AHL, is one of the pioneers in the use of open source code in trading applications. \"The best way for finance to contribute to open source is to dedicate engineering time at the organization to allow open source projects to survive,\" McKinney said. This way, open source coders will get paid for their passion.\nFor this to happen, however, finance needs to open up. Ever-secretive, financial services firms have traditionally been mistrustful of the open-source communities where everything is shared by definition. This is changing, but only on the periphery. Gary Collier, co-chief technology officer at hedge fund Man AHL, said AHL doesn\'t use open source code for the proprietary algorithms in its trading systems, but for the \"building blocks\".  Airflow, a tool developed by Airbnb, is being trialled as a scheduling device by the fund, for example.\nAs hedge funds wake up to the importance of open source, involvement in communities like Github is a valuable source of CV points for potential recruits. \"If you want to recruit top talent into an organization, the organization needs to get into open source,\" says Collier. Equally, candidates need to show evidence of involvement in open source projects. \"If you\'re a techie, you need to be on Github,\" says another senior hedge fund technologist. \"It\'s like being an artist or an architect  you need your side projects, you need to point people towards your portfolio.\"\nThis is all well and good, except developing your open source portfolio takes time. And as McKinney points out, time is short when you\'ve got a day job and family to consider. It\'s even worse if your open source project takes off. In this case, McKinney said you can become \"overburdened with success.\" For example, his Panda system  which has 9,000 stars on Github  reached a point where it required so much maintenance and stabilization time that he had little time for innovation or anything else. \"It becomes a full time job,\" said McKinney. \"Which is difficult when people are working on these things on a voluntary basis.\"\nRelated articles:\nHedge fund\'s top 24 year-old coder shares his secrets\n')[0m

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young\nTORONTO — The Toronto Zoo says attendance is up for the first time in several years, which it attributes to a baby animal boom and good weather.\nThe park says more than 1.3 million people visited the zoo in 2016, an increase of nearly 170,000 people compared to those who came to the zoo the previous year.\nZoo spokeswoman Jennifer Tracey says the births of two pandas, four white lion cubs and a rhinoceros calf are the main reasons for the attendance bump.\nAttendance had been declining since 2013, when the zoo had seen a boost due to the arrival of two pandas from China.\nTracey says a warm fall, a dry summer and a moderate spring also helped the numbers for 2016.\nShe says the attendance bump led to increased revenues.\nBy The Canadian Press\n')[0m

ALEX ARATARI / FLORIDA WEEKLY\nBring on da noise! Bring on da funk! Bring on Punta Gorda\'s favorite festival to get down and shake, rattle and roll.\nYes, Funk Fest 8 makes its crashes into City Marketplace on March 3 and 4, featuring its eternal headliners - the macabre musicians whose identities remain under wraps, Here Come the Mummies, along with 14 other bands exciting enough to tighten the Sphinx\'s sphincter.\nIn 2016, Funk Fest evolved for the first time from a one- to two-day extravaganza, with stupendous results.\n\"Last year we had about 3,000 or 4,000 people,\" said Nick Nemec, who organizes the event along with his father, Matt Nemec. \"This year, we hope it\'s going to be larger than that. Primarily the people who come to this are from outside of the area, and we\'re pretty proud of that. But we created it for our locals, so we use Punta Gorda in the name.\"\nBig Sam\'s Funky Nation. COURTESY PHOTOS\nThe Nemecs - who own Big Crush Distribution - are not only the founders of Funk Fest, but also the Big Orange Music Fest that debuted in September. They seem to have a knack for establishing successful events, which apparently includes a willingness to change things up, as they\'ll be doing with this year\'s Funk Fest.\n\"The whole thing essentially is going to be different,\" Mr. Nemec said. \"The actual property itself - the way Funk Fest is set - is going to be turned around and moved all around. It\'s going to give us a lot more festival space than last year. It\'s going to definitely let everyone spread their wings a little bit and enjoy the property more.\"\nThis year, he promises to have more than 15 vendors in the \"indie\" market, which will have merchants offering a variety of goods from hammocks to tie-dyed clothing to jewelry. Added to the mix will be a professional glass-blower who will creating and selling pieces on site, and a speed painter who will not only offer small-canvas pictures but will also be working on a mural that will progress through the duration of the festival.\nBob White, Mummy Rah and Lori White.\nOther additions include: general admission seating that\'s 30 feet closer to the stage, a larger second stage, craft beers and boutique wines offered to both VIP and general admission ticketholders and a food truck village.\nIf putting together Funk Fest sounds like a lot of work, it is.\n\"Funk Fest 7 last year was March 4 and 5,\" Mr. Nemec said. \"I think we started on Funk Fest 8 on March 9 and 10. We gave ourselves a couple of days\' reprieve, and then started hitting it up and trying to get the acts put together. It takes a full year to put together the event now.\"\nTim Reynolds & TR3\nAs with previous years, the musical acts will perform on two stages, trading off so that when one band finishes on one stage, the next band begins on another.\nThe reason band selection begins a year in advance is because, (1) there are 15 of them, and (2) attendees of past festivals make suggestions on other bands they\'d like to hear. The Nemecs also target their own favorites that they feel are a good fit - including the perennial appearance of Here Come the Mummies.\n\"This year, we have the world-famous Neville family (Dumpstaphunk, led by Ivan Neville, son of singer Aaron Neville) headlining on Saturday,\" Mr. Nemec said. \"We have Jim Reynolds, the lead guitarist for the Dave Matthews Band. They\'re going to be headlining on Friday night. Then there\'s Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad, which is No. 1 on the Billboard chart for reggae. The list goes on. It\'s pretty incredible the lineup this year.\"\nGiant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad\nThe Motet, from Colorado, is the biggest festival band right now on the circuit, he added.\n\"The Motet is really one of the sleeper bands that people around here might not know, but they\'re really well known on the West Coast of the United States. They\'re going to be a band that will leave your mouth wide open, and you\'re going to want more. They are high energy, high octane, with amazing musicianship.\"\nThe only tickets left to Funk Fest 8 are general admissions seats. The \"exclusive\" weekend pass tickets - selling at a whopping $1,500 a pop - sold out two months ago. The $130 \"premier\" were nearly gone before the end of February. And it would surprise no one if this year\'s crowds exceed 4,000. Why not?\n\"This is an all-day, all-weekend music festival that never stops,\" Mr. Nemec said. \"The music is going to be world class, mostly in the funk genre but also a lot of jazz and rock and even some country infusion. It\'s a little bit for everybody. I don\'t think anyone would come and say they didn\'t like the music.\n\"And it\'s not just music - it\'s art. It\'s a lifestyle. It\'s great cocktails, craft beers, food. It\'s going to encompass a lot of cool things.\" ¦\n>> What: Funk Fest 8\n>> When: 3:30 p.m. to midnight Friday, March 3;1:30 p.m. to midnight Saturday, March 4\n>> Where: Punta Gorda City Marketplace, across from River City Grill\n>> Cost: Advance tickets: $50 for both days, $25 for Friday only, $35 for Saturday only.\n>> Tickets and information: www.Funk- FestPuntaGorda.com\n\n\n\n')[0m

The child had otitis due to improper bathing. According to Eurostat data, with an infant mortality rate of 8.4 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2014, Romania ranks first among European countries (the EU rate is 3.7). Gangiova, Romania, Aug. 18, 2016.\n\'Good day, doctor! Good evening, doctor\', voices of people of all ages greet her kindly as Floarea Ciupitu walks around the village. At 61 she has been a family doctor serving Gangiova, a village in south-west Romania for the past three decades. Ciupitu oversees roughly 1700 registered patients. On week days she sleeps above her practice in a tiny room, on an old hospital bed. At night, a tiny flashlight guides her way one store up to her modest accommodation, no electricity on the staircase. Romania has a population of almost 20 million. Doctors in rural areas are outnumbered by peers in cities two to one, while half of the population lives in the countryside. The healthcare sector is overrun with crises and never ending problems. In 27 years since the anticommunist revolution of 1989 the country has had at least 25 health ministers take office. Doctors, especially younger ones, are fleeing the country in search of better work conditions and career opportunities. The Romanian Health Ministry states there is a severe doctors shortage. While things may look a little better in the city, Romania\'s villages are plagued with a lack of access to healthcare. Family doctors are often overworked having to care for a larger number of patients than the recommended average. Ciupitu is living proof that, despite all the difficulties and the problems in a flawed system, there still are doctors who commit to their patients. She stands to help remember that being a doctor is a calling.\n© Asger Ladefoged\nWhat happens, when 28 schoolchildren meet the controversial Danish therapist Carl-Mar Møller and are encouraged to play freely without rules? A sixth grade class from Øster Farimagsgade, a School in Copenhagen has done it twice. They went from the posh part of central Copenhagen to muddy wildness in Kokkedal, Denmark. There is only one rule at Carl-Mar Møllers place: No shoes inside. So nobody interfered with the pillowfight in the dormitory. Everything was in play and all involved left the fight exhausted and smiling.\n© Frederik Buyckx\nThere is a peculiar transformation of nature when winter comes, when snow and ice start to dominate the landscape and when humans and animals have to deal with the extreme weather. The series investigates this struggle against disappearance. The struggle against a whiteout. These photos were made in the Balkans, Scandinavia and Central Asia; remote areas where people often live in isolation and in close contact with nature. A harsh existence, fighting against superhuman forces.\n© Dino Kuznik\nI found the parking lot at Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park Visitor Center way more interesting than the actual Monument Valley.\n© Yuan Peng\nThis series was taken in a sports school in Jining, in Shandong province, China. Liu Bingqing and Liu Yujie are twin sisters, who have liked gymnastics since their childhood. They have studied, trained and grown up here.\n© Eduard Korniyenko\nIn the Soviet era, the sport of bodybuilding was not welcomed by official institutions, as opposed to weight lifting, which was judged acceptable and included in the Olympic program. But people everywhere, from small towns in the far North-East to Siberia, Moscow and even the foot of the Caucasus Mountains, persisted in going to the \"sweat box\" gyms in cellars, to \"build a body.\" Western magazines crammed with images of unrealistically muscled male and female bodies passed from hand to hand and an additional impetus to this semi-legal sport came with the growth of Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s popularity. Today, with the ban lifted, bodybuilding’s popularity has not diminished. The only difference is that some of the clubs have moved from their old basements into modern fitness centres, although the basement scene remains. A couple of times a year the participants climb the podium during various amateur and even professional tournaments. Here you can meet anyone; tax inspectors and businessmen, housewives and popular TV presenters. Regardless of social status, or whether you live in a small town in the centre of Siberia, or in a big city, the only important thing for these people is making their bodies look perfect, and being admired by others.\n© Mahesh Shantaram\nAnywhere in the world, it takes a black person to tell us what racism really feels like. On January 31st, 2016, India woke up to yet another news of a shocking mob attack against a Tanzanian student. This particular one was appalling enough to earn international press and force the nation into a period of soul-searching. Since the incident, I\'ve been traveling across the country to meet Africans and learn about their experiences. I make portraits as a personal response to give them recognition. Hamza came all the way from Nigeria to study human rights in India. This I found surprising. I didn\'t know one could study that subject here except perhaps to study its spectacular absence. Hamza is by far the most sensitive guy I\'ve ever met on this tour of Africans in India. When I asked to photograph him in his wallpapered dwelling, he requested that he be joined by his love, Shukura, a student of nursing. He says of this relationship, \"Thank you for being patient with me. Together we can prove those bitches wrong.\"\n© Dario Mitidieri\nMarch 2017 will mark the sixth anniversary of the beginning of the war in Syria. More than 470,000 people have died since. In all, 11.5% of the country’s population have either been killed or injured. 45% of the population have been displaced, 6.36 million internally and 4.8 million abroad. This is the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era.  Lost Family Portraits aims to tell the story of those who have lost family members in the Syrian war, and who have made their way to the refugee camps in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. The empty chairs or spaces in the photographs symbolize the missing family members. Lost Families Portraits is a reminder of the of the destructive power that war has over families. It is also a testimony to the 1.5 million refugees who are left behind in Lebanon, who cannot afford to buy their way into Europe and who have nothing to go back to.\nOWAYED\'S FAMILY - \"I was forced to leave my 4 sons behind.

Stuffed deers have been covered with plastic during the construction works inside the Natural History Museum of Porto. During the renovation of the museum the equilibrium and the magic of the Museum changed: the animals and the objects gained a new and bizarre life. Displaced from their defined position and out from the staged environment created for the display, they became strange objects, weird creatures inhabiting the space abandoned by the guards of the buildings.

It’s hard to imagine, but these animals, who roamed the earth for eight million years, were only discovered in the last century. Unknown, and hidden from the western world for millions of years, even today they are seen by few but known by most everyone. Found only in central China, the entire species came dangerously close to extinction. Scientists considered the giant panda a relic species; shy, and difficult to breed in captivity. But now there is a glimmer of hope, as years of research are finally paying off. In a region where bad environmental news is common, China cracked the code and is on its way to successfully saving its most famous ambassador. The giant panda was recently taken off the endangered species list!\nA cub gets weighed at Bifengxia. In the wild, once they’ve grown to adulthood, female pandas may weigh up to 220 pounds and males up to 250 pounds, and they’ll range from four to six feet long.\n© Grant Hegedus\nThis series shows what happens when you take the names of meals in a literal sense. It shows you what happens when you begin to look at the language surrounding food in a comedic way, therefore transforming what the names of the meals and foods are in to what they literally describe and making them come alive as a physical form. Above is Bangers and Mash.\n© Dongni\nA variety of urban form and minimalist architecture breaks the old structure, splitting it into triangles, squares and diamond shapes, refracting a new living style on extant spatial structures. Demonstrating a free use of the language of visual forms, it appears like a game, similar to Goldbach\'s conjecture; the destruction of the ossified template of the city, a visual exploration of breaking the rules. In a spatial context, when we ignore the aesthetics of the city, ignore the rules and celebrate the deconstruction and reconstruction of the urban space, the space itself gives us more control and adds more joy to the city.\n© Diego Mayon\nProstitution is legal in Greece and the authorities decided to stipulate that all brothels must have permits. There are different kind of brothels, the upper class ones are called Studio. The difference from the normal brothels are the buildings, more discreet, the attitude of the prostitutes, more polite, and the price, obviously higher.\nA person welcomes the clients and once inside there is a waiting room where the girls available come out to show themselves. At this point the clients decide whether to stay or to leave. These brothels are recognizable by a pink light sign with the word Studio.\n© Lorenzo Maccotta\nBucharest, Romania, April 2016: A 33-year-old cam model after his day shift in a room at Studio N2. The adult webcam industry is worth $1 billion annually, and is growing fast as the technology becomes better and cheaper.  Collectively, the sites are estimated to be visited daily by some 5 percent of the web\'s global users and the number of models performing live online shows from private apartments or from specialized studios is increasing worldwide. Romania, a country with one of the highest rates of youth unemployment in the EU, is now the undisputed world capital of studio-based cam operations, thanks to widespread wireless broadband access. The industry has grown substantially since 2001, and most major Romanian cities now count hundreds of facilities offering English-speaking male and female models—most in their twenties—fast internet connections, high definition webcams and decorated rooms where they can turn into the virtual best friends and cybersex partners of paying clients, mostly from North America, but also from European and Asian countries. In exchange for the workspace, the studios take a percentage of the models’ pay—which can reach $48,000 per month. The models are paid by platforms like Luxembourg-based LiveJasmine, one of the leading providers, ranking as the 103rd most popular site in the world and, with 25 million unique visitors monthly, the 80th most visited site in the USA.\n© Tasneem Alsultan\n\"I married my dental college classmate. Sharing two children and a happy marriage, we finally decided to buy our dream house. Two days before signing the lease, he died in a motorcycle accident. Then, my father died. I was legally required to have a male guardian. I now wait for my son to turn 16 to take that role. Until then, my step brother decides on my behalf.\"\nWhilst Saudi Arabia is an international symbol of Islam, many Saudis would agree that there\'s a strong disconnect between the Qur\'an and local traditions. I wanted to answer question that many shared: Do we need marriage to signify that we have love? Do you need a husband to have a significant life? I started the project thinking I only had my personal story to share. I was married at the age of 17, and living separately as a single parent for the last six years of an unhappy 10 year marriage. Many family members commented on how foolish I was to ask for a divorce. Only later, I realized that there were many Saudi women who had similar experiences, beyond my expectations of a typical Saudi housewife. With each story, I found more women sharing complex marriage theories and experiences. I followed the stories of widows, happily married, and divorced women. I explored the concept of love, photographing my young daughter and grandmother. Utilizing imagery (with permission from those weddings I photographed) I interlaced the construction and expectation of marriage through often elaborate wedding ceremony imagery and rituals. A common realization with every woman I photographed, was that they all managed to overcome the many hurdles that was put by society or/ and state.\n© Li Song\nIn November 2016, Li Hang, an eleven-year-old boy from Harbin, arrived at Changchun weight loss centre determined to lose weight. He had been diagnosed with Prader-Willi Syndrome when he was 3 years old, and on admission, his weight had reached 155 kilograms. Prader-Willi Syndrome is a disease related to an abnormality in chromosome 15, and in around 70% of patients is inherited from their father. It occurs in 1 in 15000 people.  Li Hang was being treated with traditional Chinese medicine every day, including massage, acupuncture, fire treatment and cupping therapy. Fire treatment is a weight loss treatment. Ingredients are applied to the body’s meridian system, with the fire process unblocking meridian points that hinder the speed of the body’s metabolic processes, all with the aim of transforming fat into energy that can be eliminated from the body. From his initial fear to this point, Li Hang has been greatly tormented, but he is supported by his faith in doing what is necessary to live a normal person’s life and to look after his mother.\n© Amber Bracken\nOceti Sakowin, or the Seven Council Fires, is the true name of the great Sioux nation and refers to the coming together of the different factions of the tribe.  Oglala, Cheyenne, Ut, Cree, Hopi and non-indigenous all are among the 200+ tribes represented in the camps and on the front lines. The last time there was a similar gathering was before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, 1876. For nearly ten months, members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and their allies have been camped in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing their land and water. The estimated $3.78 bill project is nearly complete, crossing almost 1,172 miles. But the resistance has stalled development at the Missouri River. Although on it\'s face, the issue is the pipeline, the conflict runs much deeper and is steeped in generations of violent history. These are the people of the Battle of Little Big Horn and of Wounded Knee, who were driven to starvation by the loss of the buffalo and away from their sacred Black Hills. Police treatment of water protectors hasn\'t been out of step with this history. In military vehicles and body armor, police have indiscriminately used tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, percussion grenades and water canons in sub-zero temperature. Despite all of this, the pipeline is still unresolved and water protectors are still on the land. But wether the pipeline is completed or not, the groundswell created for this resistance will certainly have reverberations for industry and indigenous people alike. I spent a month and a half, over three trips with the people in the camps.\n© Alessio Romenzi\nSirte, Libya, November 26, 2016: A fighter of the Libyan forces affiliated with the Tripoli government gets some rest whilst outside, clashes with ISIS continue in the Al Jiza neighborhood.\n© Joe Raedle\nA historic flood, caused by a massive rainstorm, hit parts of Louisiana and overwhelmed local communities, causing thirteen deaths and damaging thousands of homes with flood waters.

Over 800,000 people are still trapped in Mosul, according to estimates from the United Nations. Tens of thousands are sheltering in neighborhoods declared liberated by Iraqi forces and many more remain in parts of the city under ISIS control. Humanitarian organizations continue to fear mass displacement and civilian casualties. Many have already made the harrowing decision to flee their homes, in some cases leaving behind the bodies of loved ones who died as the fighting came to their area and had to be buried in front gardens.\n© Yulia Grigoryants\nLusine with her children in their tiny apartment in Gyumri, sleeping all 6 in the only room, that serves also as kitchen and playroom for the family. In 1988, a 7.0 Richter-scale earthquake struck northern Armenia. The quake killed at least 25,000 people in the region. Thousands more were maimed and hundreds of thousands left homeless. Gyumri, Armenia’s second largest city bore much of the damage. Large-scale war by the early 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union, an energy shortage, and a blockade that left landlocked Armenia with just two open borders contributed to exacerbating the region\'s already prevalent social and economic problems. A quarter of a century later, Gyumri has the country’s highest poverty rate at 47.7%. The city has lost nearly half of its population since 1988, due in part to the migration of the labor force. A few thousand families are still living in makeshift shelters, waiting for help. Many of them are not eligible for new housing, since they are not considered to be direct victims of the earthquake. 25 years later, they are still waiting for urgently needed improvements to their dwellings. During the Soviet era, these huge twin dormitory buildings on the outskirts of Gyumri accommodated around 60 families each. Today there are just four families living here, among decaying walls and corridors.\n© Sandra Hoyn\nKajol with her 6-month-old baby Mehedi and a customer on her bed. Two weeks after birth of Mehedi she was forced to have sex again with customers. Because of the baby her business is not good. The Kandapara brothel in the district of Tangail is the oldest and one of the largest in Bangladesh - it has existed for some 200 years. It was demolished in 2014 but has been re-established with the help of local NGOs. The brothel district is surrounded by a two-meter wall, and in the narrow streets within, there are food stalls, tea shops and street vendors. More than 700 sex workers live and work here with their children and their madams. Many of the women were either trafficked or born inside the brothel\'s walls and in this way their livelihood is secure. Their customers are policemen, politicians, farmers, fishermen, factory workers and groups of teenage boys.\n© Michael Tummings\nHidden captures man’s engagement with nature through a close examination of the practice of hunting. Hunting lies at the foundation of human survival. These unflinching photographs capture the human element in the ritualized killing of animals. Their focus is on authentic, observed moments that have been shaped by tradition, and which are still practiced in the modern world. Increasingly, our access to nature is designated as a cultural activity. Nature functions as construct of the imagination, where it is romanticized as pure and harmonious. But nature itself is marked by decay and violence. While hunting posits man as an external source of violence, the culling of animals maintains the balance and diversity of the landscape – even as it domesticates the landscape into an elaborate garden. These photographs reference the classic European tradition of paintings depicting the hunt, in addition to 20th century photographic portraiture. The rituals and divisions of class are inherent to the images in Hidden, as are both the modernization and preservation of tradition. Employing 5 x 4 analogue photography, the series uses a detached camera eye to observe the social dynamics of the group, its rituals, and the ways in which they are infused with meaning.\n© Nader Saadallah\nQuarries’ Men is a portfolio about white limestone quarries craft in Minya, Egypt and how are the workers can make and shape these Stone from the white mountain.

A gift from Japan in 1912, the 3,020 trees were planted around the Tidal Basin and East Potomac Park.\n» RELATED: 10 can\'t-miss spring festivals in metro Atlanta \n\nThe cascade of blooms inspired a three-week festival, drawing more than 1.5 million visitors to Washington each year. The 2017 National Cherry Blossom Festival takes place from March 15 until April 16, with peak bloom (the day when 70 percent of the trees around the Tidal Basin have opened their buds) predicted for March 14 to 17. The festival is filled with a variety of signature events, including Opening Ceremony on March 25 at Warner Theater, the Blossom Kite Festival on April 1 and the National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade on April 8.\n» RELATED: How to get tickets for the national African American history museum \n\nTrip tips\nA trip to the nation\'s capital for the National Cherry Blossom Festival is an item on many bucket lists, but navigating the city when it swells with fellow tourists can be overwhelming. Narrowing down what to pack, where to spot the blooms, where to stay and where to park is no small task.\nAlthough items like great walking shoes and a camera are a must, there are a few other things you\'ll want to toss in your suitcase. The pollen count surges during peak bloom, so bring Claritin or any other non-drowsy allergy medicine if you have pollen allergies, along with extra tissues and eye drops. Non-perishable snacks like trail mix and dried fruit are also good to have on hand since prices at food carts and stands along the National Mall go up during the festival.\nTo see the flowers and avoid major crowds, take a self-guided tour of the United States National Arboretum , home to 76 varieties of cherry trees. Cherry blooms are also found in Anacostia Park along the Anacostia River; the Japanese-style garden at Hillwood Estate, Museum & Gardens ; Rock Creek Park and Tudor Place in Georgetown.\n» RELATED: Wildly popular Yayoi Kusama ‘Infinity Mirrors\' exhibit coming to Atlanta\'s High Museum \n\nWhere to stay\nCherry blossom fever takes over nearly every aspect of the city, reflected by special hotel packages and menu items at area restaurants and bars. Make memories at Capella Washington, D.C., Georgetown , where the Cherry Blossom Bloom package combines a full breakfast and accommodations in a superior room, with a private Segway tour through downtown and a professional photography session among cherry blooms. The hotel will bid farewell with your framed photography upon checkout. The Drink in the Blossoms Package at The Donovan gifts guests with two cocktails from hotel restaurant Zentan , two sachets of Organic Cherry Blossom Rose tea and a postcard featuring artwork inspired by the cherry blossoms from local artist Jamie Langhoff. Finally, families will love a stay at Avenue Suites Georgetown , where each suite has a fully-equipped kitchen, allowing guests to take advantage of the property\'s Stock The Fridge program with Trader Joe\'s. Not one to miss out on cherry blossom fun, the Your Avenue to the Cherry Blossoms package includes a personalized walking map of the Tidal Basin, guaranteed parking and a complimentary drink at the on-site A Bar lounge.\nGetting around\nFinding parking is notoriously difficult in Washington, so take the efficient and comprehensive Metrorail system. If your trip is three days or more, leave your car overnight in the daily parking lot at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and take the metro (located within the airport) to downtown. Metro Center, Federal Triangle, Smithsonian, Archives and L\'Enfant Plaza stops all are within walking distance from the Tidal Basin cherry trees.\nIf driving is a must, there are free parking spaces on the National Mall along Madison and Jefferson Drives near the Smithsonian Museum, and a free parking lot at East Potomac Park, but spots fill quickly. Additionally, free on-street parking is available throughout downtown but generally restricted to two hours. Apps like SpotHero and Parking Panda , and BestParking.com allow users to find a parking space, compare rates and reserve a space at a discounted price. At all costs, avoid parking at a hotel, where rates are much higher than public lots, and office building garages.\nGetting there\nWashington, D.C., is serviced by three major area airports: Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA); Dulles International Airport (IAD); and Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Airport (BWI). DCA is the only airport directly connected to the Metrorail system via the yellow and blue lines, but IAD and BWI Airport are accessible via Metrobus and Metrorail. Various flight carriers offer nonstop flights to all three airports from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.\nFor more information on the National Cherry Blossom Festival, visit www.nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/ and for more information about Washington, D.C., visit washington.org/ .\nThis story has been updated to reflect the 2017 National Cherry Blossom Festival.

ALEX ARATARI / FLORIDA WEEKLY\nBring on da noise! Bring on da funk! Bring on Punta Gorda’s favorite festival to get down and shake, rattle and roll.\nYes, Funk Fest 8 makes its crashes into City Marketplace on March 3 and 4, featuring its eternal headliners — the macabre musicians whose identities remain under wraps, Here Come the Mummies, along with 14 other bands exciting enough to tighten the Sphinx’s sphincter.\nIn 2016, Funk Fest evolved for the first time from a one- to two-day extravaganza, with stupendous results.\n\'Last year we had about 3,000 or 4,000 people,\' said Nick Nemec, who organizes the event along with his father, Matt Nemec. \'This year, we hope it’s going to be larger than that. Primarily the people who come to this are from outside of the area, and we’re pretty proud of that. But we created it for our locals, so we use Punta Gorda in the name.\'\nBig Sam\'s Funky Nation COURTESY PHOTOS\nThe Nemecs — who own Big Crush Distribution — are not only the founders of Funk Fest, but also the Big Orange Music Fest that debuted in September. They seem to have a knack for establishing successful events, which apparently includes a willingness to change things up, as they’ll be doing with this year’s Funk Fest.\n\'The whole thing essentially is going to be different,\' Mr. Nemec said. \'The actual property itself — the way Funk Fest is set — is going to be turned around and moved all around. It’s going to give us a lot more festival space than last year. It’s going to definitely let everyone spread their wings a little bit and enjoy the property more.\'\nTim Reynolds & TR3\nThis year, he promises to have more than 15 vendors in the \'indie\' market, which will have merchants offering a variety of goods from hammocks to tied-yed clothing to jewelry. Added to the mix will be a professional glass-blower who will creating and selling pieces on site, and a speed painter who will not only offer small-canvas pictures but will also be working on a mural that will progress through the duration of the festival.\nTim Reynolds & TR3\nOther additions include: general admission seating that’s 30 feet closer to the stage, a larger second stage, craft beers and boutique wines offered to both VIP and general admission ticketholders and a food truck village.\nIf putting together Funk Fest sounds like a lot of work, it is.\n\'Funk Fest 7 last year was March 4 and 5,\' Mr. Nemec said. \'I think we started on Funk Fest 8 on March 9 and 10. We gave ourselves a couple of days’ reprieve, and then started hitting it up and trying to get the acts put together. It takes a full year to put together the event now.\'\nGiant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad\nAs with previous years, the musical acts will perform on two stages, trading off so that when one band finishes on one stage, the next band begins on another.\nThe reason band selection begins a year in advance is because, (1) there are 15 of them, and (2) attendees of past festivals make suggestions on other bands they’d like to hear. The Nemecs also target their own favorites that they feel are a good fit — including the perennial appearance of Here Come the Mummies.\n\'This year, we have the world-famous Neville family (Dumpstaphunk, led by Ivan Neville, son of singer Aaron Neville) headlining on Saturday,\' Mr. Nemec said. \'We have Jim Reynolds, the lead guitarist for the Dave Matthews Band. They’re going to be headlining on Friday night. Then there’s Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad, which is No. 1 on the Billboard chart for reggae. The list goes on. It’s pretty incredible the lineup this year.\'\nMummy Rah shows off his soul to Bob White and Lori White at Funk Fest 7 last year.\nThe Motet, from Colorado, is the biggest festival band right now on the circuit, he added.\n\'The Motet is really one of the sleeper bands that people around here might not know, but they’re really well known on the West Coast of the United States. They’re going to be a band that will leave your mouth wide open, and you’re going to want more. They are high energy, high octane, with amazing musicianship.\'\nThe only tickets left to Funk Fest 8 are general admissions seats. The \'exclusive\' weekend pass tickets — selling at a whopping $1,500 a pop — sold out two months ago. The $130 \'premier\' were nearly gone before the end of February. And it would surprise no one if this year’s crowds exceed 4,000. Why not?\nTara Nemec, Ashley Shaffer and Ginny Cormeny felt so good at Funk Fest 7.\n\'This is an all-day, all-weekend music festival that never stops,\' Mr. Nemec said. \'The music is going to be world class, mostly in the funk genre but also a lot of jazz and rock and even some country infusion. It’s a little bit for everybody. I don’t think anyone would come and say they didn’t like the music.\n\'And it’s not just music — it’s art. It’s a lifestyle. It’s great cocktails, craft beers, food. It’s going to encompass a lot of cool things.\' ¦\n>> What: Funk Fest 8\n>> When: 3:30 p.m. to midnight Friday, March\n3;1:30 p.m. to midnight Saturday, March 4\n>> Where: Punta Gorda City Marketplace,\nacross from River City Grill\n>> Cost: Advance tickets: $50 for both days,\n$25 for Friday only, $35 for Saturday only.\n>> Tickets and information: www.FunkFestPuntaGorda.com\nDumpstaphunk\n\n\n\n')[0m

Photo: Zoos SA Adrian Mann\nAdelaide Zoo has confirmed its female giant panda Fu Ni was not pregnant over the last few months despite her behaviour strongly suggesting she was experiencing labour.\nIt was the zoo\'s third attempt at helping the panda and her mate, Wang Wang, become parents as mature adults and increase the species\' population, which currently stands at less than 1900 in the wild.\nFu Ni has adopted a toy that she has been cradling and holding close to her chest since the false alarm.\nZoos SA senior panda keeper Simone Davey said the zoo had artificially inseminated panda Fu Ni twice in October.\nShe said hormonal changes and changes in her uterus had given them hope Fu Ni had become pregnant.\nRelated Coverage\nMs Davey said Fu Ni experienced contractions and heavy breathing over the weekend that were consistent and common for pandas going into pseudo labour.\n\"It\'s like a learning curve or a training mechanism for giant pandas, so they have less mismothering the first time round,\" she said.\n\"It gives them the experience to become better mothers when they are actually pregnant.\"\nMs Davey explained the large ratio difference in size between mother and foetus meant ultrasounds could not detect a cub until the last two weeks of pregnancy, which gave the keepers hope that her behaviour meant she was going into labour.\nShe said Fu Ni had experienced re-absorption, which is when all the remnants of a foetus in a failed pregnancy are absorbed back into the body, following past inseminations.\nIt meant there were no physical signs of that pregnancy having taking place.\nThis year, however, progress was made as Fu Ni went into the next stage of pseudo pregnancy, giving Zoos SA staff hope of more success in the next breeding season.\n\"This year also was the first time we saw all these other behaviours like the false labour so we\'ve actually got new information that we haven\'t seen before that will help us a lot in the future,\" Ms Davey said.\nWang Wang and Fu Ni are the only giant pandas in the southern hemisphere and were given to Adelaide Zoo at young ages so they could naturally adapt to the environment.\n\"Because we are the guinea pigs, it is a unique experience. Hopefully this breeding season we\'ll see some more improvements,\" Ms Davey said.\nOn previous occasions of pseudo pregnancy, Fu Ni\'s tendency to rub herself on objects had been considered a nesting behaviour (see gif below).\nhttp://1v1d1e1lmiki1lgcvx32p49h8fe.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AliveCheeryAstrangiacoral.webm\n-ABC\n')[0m

Labor lasts anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Once April goes into active labor, zookeepers will go in to help her the rest of the way. The calf will be about 150 pounds and 6 feet tall at birth and up and walking in about an hour.\nThe zoo said it will hold an online competition to name the baby giraffe once it\'s born.\nUS-Born Panda Bao Bao Lands in China After Leaving DC Zoo\nPublished 4 hours ago | Updated 2 hours ago\n')[0m

', 'Adelaide Zoo has confirmed its female giant panda Fu Ni was not pregnant over the last few months despite her behaviour strongly suggesting she was experiencing labour.\nIt was the zoo\'s third attempt at helping the panda and her mate, Wang Wang, become parents as mature adults and increase the species\' population, which currently stands at less than 1,900 in the wild.\nPanda facts:\nWang Wang was born in August 2005 and Fu Ni a year later at Woolong giant panda research centre in China\nThey were given to Adelaide Zoo in late 2009 for a decade but Adelaide officials hope China might agree to extend their stay\nBoth are part of an international giant panda research, conservation and breeding program aimed at preserving the endangered species\nFu Ni has adopted a toy that she has been cradling and holding close to her chest since the false alarm.\nZoos SA senior panda keeper Simone Davey said the zoo had artificially inseminated panda Fu Ni twice in October.\nShe said hormonal changes and changes in her uterus had given them hope Fu Ni had become pregnant.\nMs Davey said Fu Ni experienced contractions and heavy breathing over the weekend that were consistent and common for pandas going into pseudo labour.\n\"It\'s like a learning curve or a training mechanism for giant pandas, so they have less mismothering the first time round,\" she said.\n\"It gives them the experience to become better mothers when they are actually pregnant.\"\nMs Davey explained the large ratio difference in size between mother and foetus meant ultrasounds could not detect a cub until the last two weeks of pregnancy, which gave the keepers hope that her behaviour meant she was going into labour.\nShe said Fu Ni had experienced re-absorption, which is when all the remnants of a foetus in a failed pregnancy are absorbed back into the body, following past inseminations.\nIt meant there were no physical signs of that pregnancy having taking place.\nThis year, however, progress was made as Fu Ni went into the next stage of pseudo pregnancy, giving Zoos SA staff hope of more success in the next breeding season.\n\"This year also was the first time we saw all these other behaviours like the false labour so we\'ve actually got new information that we haven\'t seen before that will help us a lot in the future,\" Ms Davey said.\nWang Wang and Fu Ni are the only giant pandas in the southern hemisphere and were given to Adelaide Zoo at young ages so they could naturally adapt to the environment.\n\"Because we are the guinea pigs, it is a unique experience. Hopefully this breeding season we\'ll see some more improvements,\" Ms Davey said.\nOn previous occasions of pseudo pregnancy, Fu Ni\'s tendency to rub herself on objects had been considered a nesting behaviour.\nExternal Link:\nFu Ni\'s scratching had been considered a nesting behaviour.\nTopics:\nFirst posted March 02, 2017 14:05:22\n')[0m

HitTail is Back to Make You Panda Proof | Search Engine Watch', '> Industry > PR & SEOs Listen Up! HitTail is Back to Make You Panda Proof\nPR & SEOs Listen Up! HitTail is Back to Make You Panda Proof\nExactly a year ago today, you may have spotted the relaunch of HitTail... or you may have totally missed it  like I did. New CEO, Rob Walling\'s plan was to quietly relaunch his new acquisition with as little fanfare as possible. It was a Facebook ad for HitTail, saying SEO Is Dead, which got my attention at the beginning of this year. And, truthfully, to see the ad was like welcoming back an old friend.\nThat is because HitTail is one of my favorite keyword tools of all time.\nYes, I\'d forgotten its name, but for most of 2012, I regularly thought to myself, \"with what\'s happening with Panda, what people really need now is that longtail keyword tool developed by that PR company.\" Despite its almost ludicrous simplicity, HitTail has always done the one thing it does really well  namely, identifying the long tail keyword opportunities you should optimize content for.\nHitTail was first launched in 2006. It was the brainchild of Connie Connors, the CEO of New York PR company, Connors Communication. Compared to the average SEO keyword research tools, HitTail never looked like anything special  but it always punched above it\'s weight, winning lots of coverage in mainstream media.\nAs  said before, HitTail is a ludicrously simple tool. Anyone can make use of it with next to no SEO knowledge. As Cnet called it back then, in a time when blogs were still the hot new thing  it\'s \"analytics for the rest of us.\"\nHitTail\'s Backstory\nLike many keyword and analytics companies founded at the time, HitTail had to contend with Google Analytics being made freely available to everyone who would have previously bought analytics. But HitTail was always a pretty low cost tool that was remarkably good at maintaining clients.\nAround 2009 the software was starting to show it\'s age, suffering from downtime and bugs were creeping in. In 2010, Rob Walling, a HitTail customer of 5 years, emailed Connors and offered to buy the software. Connors agreed to an undisclosed sum and sold the software and the servers it sat on (remember in 2005 when we all had our own servers?) to Walling.\nWalling is an interesting type of web entreprenuer. He has a team of developers and buys old software companies and refurbishes their products. He then runs the new product on as much as it needs to be profitable (This is not too dissimilar to what Jim Boykin is doing with Webmaster World and Threadwatch which relaunched yesterday ). Walling calls this micropreneurship .\nSetting to work, Walling\'s team cleared up the 28 or so bugs that had crept into the system, hired a database administrator and moved the entire software as a service (SaaS) to the cloud. All the keywords tracked have been maintained such that some clients now have a 5 year archive of keywords that sit outside of the Googleplex.\nRelaunched exactly a year ago, via a quick post on Hacker News , Walling\'s new HitTail has suffered no downtime and the improved database means current customers have seen their keyword suggestions increase ten fold. Profits have also increased ten fold, meaning more resources can be re-invested to improve the product.\nSo far, whilst there has been no major functionality change to HitTail, under the new leadership, the software platform now has quick integration with Hubspot, may develop better AdWords integration and a WordPress plugin will be released next week.\nWhat Does It Do?\nAll HitTail does is track all your incoming keywords to your site, stack them against each other in a bar graph and then identify which are the best long tail opportunities for you personally. It\'s magic is in a simple algorithm which identifies the keywords you should write more about based on the keywords that are driving traffic to your site.\nWhat You Write About Can Rank\nBack then in 2006, for the average SEO, such an analysis could seem like a pursuit of diminishing returns. The labor required to produce the content was most likely not worth the traffic gains. Content production was a chore and most businesses were not open to it  they didn\'t get why content was important.\nSEO was about gaining big traffic wins in a competitive environment, so we would turn to tools like WordTracker which was excellent at comparing traffic volume against competitiveness. But Wordtracker never had a simple solution for understanding the compeitiveness of the keyword phrases you were already attracting  which, in a nutshell, is exactly what HitTail does.\nSpeaking personally, as a freelance SEO, in a dead heat between the two tools, WordTracker would usually win my money, yet nonetheless, I still found myself paying for HitTail every now and then on their month to month plans for certain new clients.\nThat\'s because HitTail\'s data is eminently actionable. It\'s as actionable as panhandling for gold and finding a nugget. If you don\'t find that nugget, you move elsewhere, but if you do, boy oh boy, do you take action. Essentially HitTail automates the process of panhandling for potentially golden keyword phrases from all your incoming search query data.\nWhat it lacks in robust analysis it makes up for in total clarity. The SEO tenet it is based on is so simple, so utterly uncomplex, that it took a PR person (someone who lives and breathes content) to boil it down for the rest of the industry.\nNamely, \"What you write about can rank.\" It\'s true! Regardless of algorithms, links and anchor text, this little fact of the internet elucidates the inalienable right of content creators on the web. Anyone can write about anything, and all of it can rank on search engines.\nThe question then remains: Now that you know you have that freedom, regardless of whether you will succeed or not, what do you want to rank for?\nEvery SEO Needs To Return To That One Simple Idea\nSEOs can be forgiven for believing that HitTail\'s analysis is an over simplification  a philosophical stretch too far to be considered a robust SEO tool. It could fairly be dismissed as a better tool for Bloggers. Nonetheless, with boots firmly in the SEO camp, I beg to differ.\nHitTail originated from blog land amongst a subset of web users who, from the beginning have been conceptualizing their own web marketing efforts in terms of relationships rather than links, and content rather than keywords. To bloggers, incoming search traffic has just been another channel to grow an audience and develop a more personal relationship with their readers. Bloggers don\'t write to rank on search engines, they write for people in order to grow their community  whatever search traffic they got was just a bonus.\nPR professionals who get SEO are the same. They understand that search traffic is out there, but beyond search, the aim of PR is to make the message land on listening ears. Where SEOs see cumulative traffic stats, PR professionals see tiny niches of influencers that they can target.\nThat the way in which SEO and PR services are packaged up for clients is completely different, points to core methodological differences in our approaches to online marketing.\nYet, we\'re not so different as we think. Where SEOs need to be on a monthly retainer to do link development until rankings pay off, PR professionals need to be on a monthly retainer to do story development, until the big placement pays off.\nSEO companies aim to get their client on the front page of Google and Bing, whilst PR companies aim to get their client on the front page of the Wall Street Journal.\nIn the wake of Panda and Penguin, Google\'s message is clear. Links need to be won through a blend of cunning search strategy and equally cunning PR strategy. Google may have a war on links but it is certainly not a war on relationships. Google\'s radual socialization of search results is simply changing the link building model to one more of earned media (and arguably what is was always meant to be).\nYet that is not to say, SEO is now PR or vice versa. But both can learn from each other. As Ken McGaffin, former marketer for WordTracker so brilliantly states in 10 Reasons Why Public Relations is a ‘Must-do\' for SEO in 2013 , there\'s a tremendous cascade effect on links as a result of good PR.\nWhat PR knows is that one good article with the right placement (normally a publication) is the difference between getting picked up by the journalist community and going nowhere. What SEOs know is that good rankings on a few terms can bring even more good rankings for many more terms in the long run. Todd Malicoat has always put that ranking phenomenon best, \"all ships rise with the tide.\"\nSo what if the placement of that one good article happens to be at the top of search results? That\'s the core idea HitTail sells the SEO community and that idea is fundamentally Panda proof.\nHitTail enables bloggers, journalists and SEOs to find that one good keyword that has the best chance of getting that one good placement on the front page of Google. The rest flows from there. Hopefully your story will get picked up and linked to by higher order publications and you will have naturally improved your link profile.\nUltimately, We Earn Our Keywords\nIf you are an SEO, you\'ll know this better than most: that  one top ranking for a long tail keyword is the crack that lets the light in. From the success of one phrase you can divine the current and future success of your entire SEO strategy. But Google\'s has spent a year taking our keywords away from us and burying it in webmaster tools.\nAll webmasters should consider that they have earned, fairly and squarely, the keyword data that sent traffic to your website. If Google is going to encrypt data and block tools  that are useful to the functioning of your business and critically important to understanding your customers  then it might be time to start thinking about how you can take that data out of Google as soon as you can.\nUltimately Google can touch and peek into every other apsect of web data, but it still can\'t touch your own website data or take that away from you. Regardless of the ethics of Google SPYWorld and encrypted referrers, every public piece of keyword data I have ever analyzed was fairly earned by the websites I own, manage, funded or created.\nThe Bottom Line\nThere\'s no doubt that I am gushing with enthusiasm for HitTail. By no means was it perfect back then, and in a Skype conversation, Walling candidly admitted to some imperfections now. For many users it will still be frustrating that related keyword suggestions are still not searchable. It\'s still an incredibly simplistic piece of software.\nHowever, this refurbishment is a step in the right direction. With new resources and a profitable future ahead of it, Walling plans to develop the product according to what users ask for.\nWhilst I already have a list as long as my arm for new feature requests, simply what HitTail\'s can do for me now is important enough. HitTail can take my keyword data out of the machinations of the Googleplex and put it back into my hands.\nSimilarly HitTail has preserved the keyword list their clients have earned for over 5 years now, therefore that tool seems like a good insurance plan to me against a keywordless future. From my discussions with Walling it seems clear to me that there could be an opportunity for customers to help formulate the direction of the service  and right now, post-Panda and post Google SPYWorld, the SEO community needs a new keyword tool.\nFor the record, my dream is that HitTail and Wordtracker team up and make babies.\nWant to stay on top of the latest search trends?\nGet top insights and news from our search experts.\n')[0m

That all looks good, but the best figure of all is the directors\' hiking of the full-year dividend by 15.3%. I think that move speaks volumes about the how they see the health of the business and its prospects.\nAfter reflecting on \"another very good year\", non-executive chairman John Nichols said he expects the firm\'s clear strategy for growth to overcome challenging soft drinks markets during 2017. His confidence is underpinned by the company\'s strong brands, diversification and successful track record of growth.\nThose all-important brands include names such as Vimto, Panda, Sunkist, Levi Roots and Feel Good Drinks. As well as diversity of brands, the firm has sales diversified across markets with Vimto, for example, selling in more than 85 countries. Meanwhile, its track record of growth speaks for itself.\nYear to December\n2011\n')[0m

That should stop people leaving quite so many angry comments under stories, they hope.\nStories that use the quiz will see people presented with three short multiple choice questions that they must give the correct response to. So, for instance, people might have to correctly answer what an acronym that is used in the story stands for, for instance.\nTrump confused with Alec Baldwin\'s SNL impersonation by newspaper\nThe creators of the tool – which for the moment is in use on NKRbeta, the broadcasters\' tech page – hope that it will ensure that everyone knows what they\'re talking about before they actually start talking about it.\n\"We thought we should do our part to try and make sure that people are on the same page before they comment,\" journalist Ståle Grut told Nieman Lab, which first reported the news . If everyone can agree that this is what the article says, then they have a much better basis for commenting on it.\'\nThe extra time should also force people to think a little more deeply about what they are commenting on.\n\'If you spend 15 seconds on it, those are maybe 15 seconds that take the edge off the rant mode when people are commenting,\' said Marius Arnesen, editor of NKRbeta.\nMost of NKRbeta has developed a dedicated following who talk positively in the comments on its articles. But occasionally its stories are published on the homepage or elsewhere – which brings a whole new set of often angry readers, who tend to undermine the tone in the comments, said NKRbeta journalists.\nMany sites have got rid of comments altogether, arguing that they are becoming hard to maintain, tend to become negative quickly and that people can have their own conversations on Facebook or elsewhere.\nOther websites have attempted to tackle the problem with different technologies. Google announced last week, for instance, that it had built an artificially intelligent tool that can read through comments and identify whether or not they are \"toxic\".\nMore about:\nNewspapers\n')[0m

Your faith, dear Nintendo worshippers, has not been misplaced as Breath of the Wild marks a fantastic addition to the already mighty series. \nBreath of the Wild sees our elf-like adventurer wake from a 100-year slumber with no memory and Calamity Ganon ruling over Hyrule. From here, Link must piece together his memories, discover his true purpose, and attempt to save the world and Princess Zelda. If losing his memory wasn’t bad enough, Link must also free four gigantic divine beasts and traverse an open world where almost everything is deadly.\nThis, of course, marks the most significant and overwhelmingly positive change to happen to the long running series. Breath of the Wild may be the 19th main-series Zelda game but it’s the first to be completely open-world. Being free to roam the expansive (read: overwhelmingly huge) pastures of Hyrule is magnificent. \nWant to delve into a shrine you spotted seemingly miles away? You can! Want to forget the main quest and document everything on your camera? You can! Want to speak to the local village and complete side quests? You can! Want to spend all your time feeding apples to your horse? You can! The possibilities feel limitless. And for those wanting to complete the main quest, there’s a quasi-structure that requires a lot of exploration but nearly always makes you feel that you’re progressing. \n \nA little on the aforementioned shrines: unlike in previous Zelda games where each cave was few and far between but were long and challenging, the new system means caves are relatively short, offering one or two major challenges. However, there are dozens upon dozens spread throughout Hyrule so their brevity doesn’t matter as another challenge awaits around the corner. Importantly, completing each shrine rewards you an orb: four of these you can exchange for either a heart container or more stamina. You\'ll need to upgrade these sooner rather than later because, guess what, you\'ll be dying. A Lot. We\'re talking dozens and dozens of times. It\'s wonderfully challenging. \nAnother major new change to the series is that swords, shields, and bows break relatively often, meaning you will have to find new equipment to use. This can be frustrating, as your favourite sword won’t be around very long if you\'re swinging like a mad man. Luckily, each enemy drops their weapon when they perish, meaning you can save that favourite sword for when the inevitable boss appears. One little nitpick here is that the system to select weapons is slightly difficult to maneuver: obviously, it was built with the Wii U’s second screen in mind.

The Slate has two functions: firstly, it provides a map that can be used to create waypoints and see where major quests need you to go. Second, as you progress, you acquire runes that give Link certain powers, such as creating bombs and stopping objects from moving for a limited amount of time. \nThese different powers are used to traverse different obstacles in unique ways, offering enough variety and upgradeability to keep you more than occupied. The only disappointing Rune is the literal camera, which can be used to capture creatures, monsters, and areas, adding their picture to your compendium. Compared to bombs, it’s not exactly exciting. \nOf course, there are core Zelda mainstays that keep Breath of the Wild a Zelda game. Not only are Zelda, Link and Gannon back, but so are the classic sounds, Rupees, and some enemies. The combat system also remains similar, with swords, bombs, and your bow and arrow remaining the main way to defeat enemies.\nNintendo Switch review: the ultimate handheld released too soon\nHaving been in production so long, many fans have been worried about the game’s graphics. On Nintendo Switch, the stylised look works fantastically, even on the small screen. On TV, though, the game comes into its element, the long draw distance being absolutely breath-taking. More importantly, though, like that Lion King meme, everything you see can be yours (to explore). \nThat’s just the half of what Breath of the Wild has to offer. Earlier, I called it ‘overwhelming,’ which has somewhat negative connotations. At times, there feels like there is just so much to explore - where do you begin? But, somehow, Breath of the Wild keeps you on track. You don’t feel lost at any stage as you know, quite simply, that Ganon needs to be defeated. By keeping things simple while giving you seemingly infinite things to do, Nintendo has created an almost perfect Zelda game and one I can’t put down. A must-have for any Nintendo lover.\nReuse content\n')[0m

If you’ve ever pinched an orange peel and tasted the oil that oozes from the rind, it’s like that, only without the citrus accents.\"\nMr Fahey suggested that he could taste some of the same flavour on cartridges from the old Nintendo Entertainment System and the Super NES, but that it was a more faint taste and it didn\'t stick around.\nReuse content\n')[0m

He thinks those odds can be improved.\nAmitai Etzioni\n03.02.17 6:00 AM ET\nIf you are the betting type, I have a promising bet for you. Wager that the United States and China will engage in a major war in the near future. Some scholars who specialize in international relations, such as John Mearsheimer, contend that a war between the United States and China is more likely today than a \'hot\' war between the United States and the USSR ever was. Timothy Garton Ash, a British historian and commentator, states that the United States and China will \'probably\' go to war if they do not carefully manage the slew of points of tension between them. Michael Pillsbury, an expert with four decades of experience studying U.S.-China relations, observes that China’s lack of military transparency practically guarantees inadvertent escalation, leading to war.\nOthers consider a war with China inevitable because of an \'iron law\' of history, according to which prevailing superpowers such as the United States necessarily fail to yield power quickly enough to a new power such as China, thereby causing rising tensions and, eventually, war. Graham Allison writes, \'The defining question about global order for this generation is whether China and the United States can escape Thucydides’s Trap. The Greek historian’s metaphor reminds us of the attendant dangers when a rising power rivals a ruling power … [Avoiding war] required huge, painful adjustments in attitudes and actions on the part not just of the challenger but also the challenged.\' Even optimists, against whom you’d be betting, give the United States and China only a one in four chance of avoiding war. According to Allison’s report, superpowers adjusted and avoided war with rising powers in four out of sixteen cases since 1500. (In one of these cases, Great Britain yielded to the United States during the late 1800s and early 1900s.)\nThis book hopes to sour your bet (with due apologies) by outlining several policies that may allow us to achieve a peaceful transition of power without endangering the United States’ core interests in Southeast Asia—or undermining the United States’ position as a global power. To find a peaceful way, both the United States and China need to change their foreign policies. Scores of books and articles argue what China must do: stop its military buildup, improve its transparency, bring its military more under the control of the government rather than the Communist Party, and transition to a liberal democracy, among other recommendations. This book, in contrast, is written by an American for Americans; it focuses on the actions the United States could take to reduce the probability that the world will face another major war.\nI cannot stress enough that when I point in the following pages to flaws in the ways that the United States is currently dealing with China (for instance, by excluding it from the Trans Pacific Partnership), this does not mean that China has conducted itself better or does not need to mend its ways. It simply means that China’s warts have been amply charted and dissected; this book focuses on what the United States could do better.\nTo proceed, Americans need to engage in a national dialogue, a public debate about what the United States’ China policy is and should be. The United States often engages in such debates about other subjects, such as same-sex marriage, climate change, dealing with ISIS and with Iran. Such a national debate about China policy has not yet happened.\nIndeed, during the most recent presidential primary season, both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates have mainly avoided the subject, though Donald Trump argued that China is out to \'eat our lunch.\' Now that the elections are over, and a new administration has come in, this is a particularly opportune time to engage in such a public debate. This book seeks to serve this overdue give-and-take.\nGoing to or sliding into war with a rising China is especially tragic because—as I see it—China and the United States share many complementary interests and have surprisingly few substantive reasons to come to blows. (By \'substantive\' I mean those issues that are distinct from symbolic or hyped-up ones, such as the question of who owns a pile of rocks somewhere difficult to find on a map.)\nSome use the terms \'panda huggers\' and \'dragon slayers\' to categorize analysts and public leaders in the West according to the approaches they recommend adopting toward China; these terms replace the \'doves\' and \'hawks\' of the Cold War. (I sometimes refer to them as \'Engagers\' and \'Adversarians.\')\nSome might consider this book to fall on the dovish side. However, I am not a \'panda hugger\' but rather someone who has been to war. This experience left me with a strong commitment to seeking peaceful resolutions to international conflicts.\nThe overdue public debate about America’s China policy will not take place in a vacuum. The U.S. military, in the course of carrying out its duty to secure the United States, has identified China as a major strategic threat. Accordingly, it has made the case in the media, in congressional hearings, and in presentations to the White House that the United States should take a tougher approach to China and should build up its military in order to prepare for a war with China. The defense industry supports the same charge for its own reasons. To digress, I do not claim that there exists a military-industrial complex in the sense of a solid military-corporate bloc whose representatives meet at night in a motel in Arlington to plot how to gain glory and profit by pushing the United States into war with China. As a matter of fact, the U.S. military’s various services compete with each other; thus the U.S. Army is much less inclined to target China than the U.S. Air Force and Navy are. And many corporations that make money out of peaceful pursuits compete with defense-focused ones, and defense corporations compete with each other. However, as we shall see, major segments of the military and corporations do have strong, vested interests in preparing for war with China for reasons that do serve their constituents, but not necessarily the good of the United States.\nReprinted from the forthcoming AVOIDING WAR WITH CHINA: Two Nations, One World by Amitai Etzioni by permission of the University of Virginia Press.\nAmitai Etzioni is University Professor in the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies at George Washington University.

He looks every bit the former athlete; you can see how he took 342 first-class wickets.  When he finds me a chair and puts it next to him, I may not literally be his right-hand man, but for this one-dayer (a List A game, not an official ODI) between Hong Kong and Netherlands , I\'m sitting to the right of Hong Kong\'s coach.\nThat will be my place for the next two games. For the first half of the match, I\'m afraid of moving in case I break some sort of PMOA (players media officials access) code, so I don\'t even go to the toilet. And also because the Netherlands manager has made it clear he is not happy I am here.\nCook sits at a trestle table. He has a laptop open and a notebook. Behind his laptop is a big screen, and next to that screen is the analyst Chris \"Wilson\" Pickett\'s laptop, which is running the Sports Mechanics analyst software. Pickett looks like the kind of wiry opening bat who would annoy you by playing and missing a lot. He previously worked with Sussex, and coaches Hong Kong Dragons, the Hong Kong Chinese team.\nHong Kong are fielding. Cook doesn\'t give a big speech just before play; they just get out there and do their jobs. Opening bowler Ehsan Nawaz starts the day with five wides. There will be another wide and a misfield in the first over.\nBut there is a bigger problem.\nHong Kong Cricket are pioneers in many ways. They live-stream their games, and not just with a single-camera set-up and the sound of the ground, but with multiple cameras and commentators. The camera crew and producers are experts in their field but not experts in cricket. As the bowler hits the crease, they cut to a sideways view of the game. At other times they focus not on the ball but on close-ups of the stumps. And they regularly put up replays of certain balls ahead of live cricket.\nThis drives Pickett crazy, as it\'s his job to enter all the data in. At times he has to run between overs and try to train the crews on how to cover the game. For the second game he puts up his own camera and uses that. Associate teams realise that embracing data, as many of the big teams have done, will give them certain advantages. At this level, you can only afford so many mistakes .\nOnce they start getting their data, they see something straight away that bothers them. Nawaz is over-correcting. He bowls big inswingers to left-handers, but when he bowls straight, they swing down the leg side, and when he bowls wide, they don\'t swing and are often called wides.  Hong Kong have been working on this for a while now.\nJamie Atkinson , one of their star batsmen, is at slip. Atkinson was Hong Kong captain and big things were expected of him, but he had to give up the captaincy when he got a job as a teacher. The batsman takes a big swipe at the ball and there is a flashing edge straight to Atkinson. He never sees it. It smashes him on the head. He plays out the game but has no real impact on it. When he continues to feel unwell, he is taken to a doctor and diagnosed with concussion. He doesn\'t play in the follow-up game.\nPickett and Cook look at the early groupings from their seamers. They are bowling full and wide when the plan was to bowl shorter and very straight, almost on the leg-and-middle line. From their data and planning, they have seen that both batsmen like the front foot, so banging it into the deck also gives their bowlers more room for error. Cook asks 16-year-old Jhatavedh Subramanyan , the 13th man, to pass the message on to Aizaz Khan, the other opening bowler. Hong Kong today have four teenagers in the XI, the youngest being 17. In the next game they have five.\nHayat is calm, Rath is eager. Rath tries to push the game forward, Hayat tries to slow it down. They both handle pace and spin. They both look like natural batsmen and as if they intimately understand how to construct a one-day chase\nSubramanyan runs off to fine leg with the message. Aizaz starts his next over with a half-volley, which is driven for four. A couple of balls later another full ball is driven away. Cook looks on silently. Then he turns to me and wonders what happened. Perhaps the message wasn\'t passed on correctly or forcefully enough. Maybe the bowler decided the advice was wrong and his plan was better. Or it could just be that the bowler doesn\'t have control of his length enough to execute the right ball.  Later Cook asks me what I think of Bob Woolmer\'s plan to have an earpiece to talk to the captain. He probably wishes he had them for all his players.\nOffspinner Ehsan Khan takes the wicket of Ben Cooper, and Cook passes on a new note: just bowl for dots. The thinking is that this isn\'t a wicket where you can attack, so the best way is to make the batsmen play shots they shouldn\'t be playing. Instead, Netherlands start hitting sixes.\nCook reluctantly leaves the tent for a commentary stint, which has been cleared by the match referee. It\'s the sort of thing that leading international coaches don\'t often do.\nIn the 27th over, Hong Kong\'s batting prodigy, 19-year-old Anshy Rath , comes on to bowl. They worry that Rath, a decent left-arm fingerspinner when in form, might have the yips. He clearly does, and is taken for 16 runs.  In the next match, he\'s brought on in the 42nd over and goes for 15 runs. Between the games Cook had Rath bowling with his eyes closed, and he bowled perfectly, the problem was, he wasn\'t going to be able to do that in the match.\nHong Kong\'s captain, Babar Hayat , is an intriguing tactician. \"Babar has plans that no on this earth can understand,\" Pickett will say of him at one stage.\n\"That\'s why we get investigated,\" says Pickett about how Hong Kong have had to explain themselves to the ACSU before. \"They think we\'re fixing, but we\'ve just got a lot of strange ideas.\"\nAfter Rath\'s over they get a bonus wicket as Ehsan, the spinner and slogger, takes a good catch on the boundary, right in front of the HK tent, and then turns and screams at the team. Someone jokes that he might have been upset with some comments about his fielding. But it turns out that in taking the catch, he has he managed to split the webbing in his fingers. Subramanyan asks if he will go back out there, \"Of course,\" he says, \"this happens all the time.\" Sarah Whitehead, the physio, carefully tries to patch up the problem and quickly gets him back on the field. Ehsan\'s hands are more tape than fingers. Two overs later he is back off, as his hand is bleeding, and Whitehead goes through the motions again.\nHong Kong continually set fields for Netherlands captain Peter Borren , keeping mid-on and mid-off up. They also put a specialist fielder for the reverse sweep. None of these things bothers Borren. He still plays the reverse sweep. \"Reverse sweep is an ego shot,\" Cook says. Later Borren slaps a straight six.\nCook believes in the roles triangle, which is asking a player to accept his role within the team, train in the skills needed for that role, and then execute it on match days. This isn\'t easy to explain to players who are the stars of their clubs and don\'t understand that at this level they might just be role players.\nThere are also problems specific to Hong Kong Cricket. Like, for the longest time, they essentially only had eight players they could confidently pick. They picked the three best fielders from the rest. That was because there isn\'t much cricket played in Hong Kong. Sometimes players can go three weeks without a game because there simply aren\'t enough grounds in the country - eight in total if you include all the AstroTurf grounds and the school grounds on which they roll out a temporary wicket.\nThere are also culturally specific problems. One young player was offered the chance to play in an emerging-teams tournament against Sri Lanka and India, but he turned it down because it would interfere with his schooling. Another player, Shahid Wasif , is a student who also works as a security guard from 7pm to 7am.\nBabar Hayat is run out for 86 in the second one-dayer   Panda Man\nNetherlands end with 330 runs. As they eat their lunch, Cook and Pickett discuss the fact that Hong Kong bowled 50% dot balls but also let through a boundary an over. They believe their bowlers think ball by ball, like amateurs, rather than about stringing together good overs and spells.\nCook takes out a whiteboard and writes where he wants the team to be at 15 overs (95 for 2), and where he wants them at 35 (222 for 4).\nBorren bowls the third over after his opener, Vivian Kingma, bowls a shocker, and Cook wistfully says how great it would be to have someone with that sort of experience in his side, who can also do whatever is needed at any time\nThe other opening bowler, Paul van Meekeren , is bowling fast, and some of his balls are tagging sideways. Pickett talks about how they have data on van Meeekeren, and how with the Sports Mechanics app, the players can watch any bowler any time they want to learn more about them.\nThe chat moves to stealing runs, and running in general. The team has just had a revolution in the way they think about running between the wickets, and while they have seen more runs, they have also seen more run-outs.  Cook just wants them to think there is a run every ball, to have that intent.\nAs he talks about this, 19-year-old opener Chris Carter is out there batting. Carter is clearly a talented player, but he is also new to being a specialist batsman. His technique is strong, his eye is decent, but he gets trapped in his innings (he makes 24 from 64 in the next game) and can\'t find singles. His batting is fine; his run-making needs work.\nAnd it\'s not just him. Both teams have players who hit boundaries but who don\'t rotate the strike enough.  Cook wants all his players to know that a defensive shot doesn\'t just need to go straight back to the bowler. That you can drop your hands, turn your wrists, or even move across the crease before the ball is bowled to change the angle. As he talks about it, Carter is out lbw after not picking the left-arm wristspinner.\nThe concussed Atkinson follows soon after, and at 51 for 2, there is a bit of worry in the team. With Hayat and Rath at the crease, Cook turns his attention to the next batsman, Nizakat Khan .  He tells him they don\'t need to over-attack, they have time to knock it around and just go at 5.5 an over for the next 20 overs. But if the ball is there to be hit, hit it. You get the feeling that Cook always is a bit cautious with his middle order, because although they don\'t need much prompting to go full nuclear.\nCook takes a big breath and gets up. After the handshakes he takes his team out to the middle. He speaks softly, like a disappointed teacher. He wants them to know that they played outstandingly well, but from 250 for 2, they threw it away\nCarter comes over to Cook\'s computer and looks at his lbw a few times, as much as anything to see if it is out, and then to confirm what he thought: he chose the wrong ball to reverse-sweep and didn\'t pick which way it was spinning. He then looks at a couple of his boundaries. What he doesn\'t look at is the many balls he didn\'t score off. For Carter, the boundaries aren\'t the problem - he will hopefully learn to read wrist spin better. The most simple way he can improve is by facing fewer dots.\nThere is a huge shout behind for Rath\'s wicket, but the umpire is unmoved. A message from the middle at drinks confirms that he had smashed it. Hayat gets dropped, and that noticeably relaxes the team.\nRath and Hayat also batted together for a very long time in the first-class match before the two one-dayers.  Hayat made 173 and 31, Rath 98 not out and 88.\nThe two of them are so different. Rath looks well coached, thinks cleverly about the game, and you can feel him itching to score. When he goes over mid-off, it is as cricket is intended. He has great feet and hands. A middle-order player at his best, thrust into the top of the Hong Kong order, in the last few months he has finally made the most of his obvious batting talent. Very soon he will sign with a county .\nHayat plays languid strokes and hits the ball smoothly. There have been worries about his fitness. Often he plays one big innings and then struggles. But here he is, batting beautifully, even if his running between the wickets is at times non-existent (he is run out at a crucial moment in the second one-dayer, because he was ball-watching).\nTheir partnership is well constructed. Hayat is calm, Rath is eager. Rath tries to push the game forward, Hayat tries to slow it down. They both handle pace and spin. They both look like natural batsmen and as if they intimately understand how to construct a one-day chase. At the end of the series Borren says the Hong Kong top order is very good, and he should know just from bowling at Rath and Hayat practically all tour.\nWhen a six is hit into the local apartments, the Hong Kong players cheer, but the coaching staff know that when a ball is hit there, it costs US$100, as you can\'t go into the private residence to get it back.\nEven with the sixes, Hayat\'s majestic calm and Rath\'s professional scoring, the next man in, Nizakat, is very nervous. He sits behind Cook and Pickett, and Cook\'s calming chats do not do the trick. You can feel his nervous energy, or hear his spikes rattling on the concrete nervously. He asks Pickett how many overs are left for each bowler. Later he asks again. And then one more time. \"Just don\'t worry about it, go out there and bat,\" Pickett finally tells him. It\'s quite a thing for the analyst to say, but it\'s probably what Nizakat now needs to do.\nEhsan Khan appeals for a wicket in the drawn first-class game   Panda Man\nRath brings up his hundred, and Hayat keeps going as well. They need 82 off the final ten overs with eight wickets remaining.  It is not going to be easy, but they could not be in a much better position chasing 331.\nThen Hayat is out stumped to Borren, and despite Hong Kong being ahead in the game, I sense Cook get nervous. He picks up a plastic spoon from the ground and starts playing with it.  I start to see a pattern when Cook is nervous: he will get silent, fixate on something small, and then jump up suddenly to impart some guidance for the next player.\nNizakat, after all his nervousness off the field, looks quite comfortable on it.  He smashes Borren for a six and then flat-bats a van Meekeren short ball back into the apartment complex. Nizakat is an extraordinary talent. He goes from looking like he is about to miss the ball by a foot to creaming it over extra cover for six. He smashed a hundred against the Sydney Thunder bowlers in a practice match before the Big Bash this season, bringing up the milestone in the last over with a six. In the second game against Netherlands, he runs down the wicket at Roelof van der Merwe and plays a squash shot over cover for six.\nWith Nizakat and Rath at the crease, the target comes down to 46 from 36 balls. But at no stage does Cook feel overly confident.\nRath then tries to put away a poor ball from Michael Rippon, but hits it very high and is caught for 134. Rath is fuming as he comes off the ground. His 130 is brilliant, but as he reaches the change room, he screams the sort of word that ESPNcricinfo doesn\'t publish. Cook leans into me and says, \"It\'s great to see someone that that kind of anger after they\'ve made a hundred\".\nNizakat hits the next ball straight to long-on.  \"That is brainless,\" Cook says to no one in particular. He writes an angry note in his book before placing it aggressively back on his desk. The whole camp feels edgier now. If Cook was the first to feel really nervous, they\'ve now all joined him.\nIt\'s 30 off 24 balls with five wickets in hand and no set batsman at the crease. The two batsmen in the middle are so nervous, at one stage one goes down the wrong end to bat at the end of the over. Cook laughs a gallows laugh.\nHe has already spoken to both batsmen out in the middle, and now he goes to the remaining batsmen and talks them through what they need to do. He could not be more calm or clear: We should play van der Merwe out. Van Meekeren will bowl short, use his pace to hit him behind the wicket. And most importantly wait for boundary balls. Netherlands are under just as much pressure as we are.\nThen Ehsan, who had been slogging luckily, is given out lbw. All the Hong Kong players believe it is off the glove and they crowd around the replay, which shows pretty much that. It is an exceptionally poor decision at a very crucial moment. No one mentions that Rath edged a catch early in his innings and wasn\'t given out.\nNow no players are sitting down, it is too tense, they pace as individuals, but it\'s a group worry. Cook doesn\'t send messages out to the middle at the end of each over, he doesn\'t panic, and he doesn\'t do much, he just tries to make sure every batsman is prepared and plays sensible cricket.\nA full ball is scooped into the leg side. Netherlands scream \"Catch\", a lone Hong Kong voice screams \"No.\"  And then the catch is taken. Someone says that the tail always do this, someone else says, \"That\'s why we shouldn\'t let them in.\"  Another wicket falls, and the talk stops altogether. Cook just refolds his arms.\nWhen a six is hit into the local apartments, the Hong Kong players cheer, but the coaching staff knows that when a ball is hit there, it costs US$100, as you can\'t go into the private residence to get it back\nThey have consistently lost wickets to shots that were not on. When the ninth wicket falls, Hong Kong need 16 off ten balls. Carter walks up to where his gloves have been drying in the sun and picks them up.  If ever there was a sign that the No. 11, Tanveer Ahmed, is not expected to help them win, it\'s this. An edged boundary from him gets them close; they need 11 from 8, then ten from the last over. Nadeem Ahmed will face it; van Meekeren will bowl it.\nNadeem mishits the first ball. No run is taken. \"Just gotta get one of those away,\" says Cook. Then a wide from a short ball. Another mishit, another run refused. Then another knocked-back single, which drives Cook mad. Then another wide. Then a taken single. \"Why take it now?\" says Cook. Another single. At no stage has either batsman tried to use the pace of van Meekeren against him. They knew he was going to bowl short. He did bowl short, and they did nothing with it.\nThe batsmen almost exchange bats after a chat. Pickett laughs, Cook just shakes his head in disbelief. They need a six off the last ball to tie. It is mistimed to long-off. They don\'t even take the single.  Someone mentions net run rate, but it\'s not the most important thing on people\'s minds.\nCook takes a big breath and gets up. After the handshakes he takes his team out to the middle. He speaks softly, like a disappointed teacher. He wants them to know that they played outstandingly well, but from 250 for 2, they threw it away. He tells them they were neither calm nor smart, and references another game where the same thing happened. He praises their talent but questions their decision-making. \"We want to make a name for ourselves and we had a chance to do that today.\" He tails off at the end.\nI go back to my seat to pack up.  Cook comes over and asks me what I think about the game. At first I am flattered. I think I have penetrated the inner circle. I am an analyst. But then I realise that in truth, he\'s just out of answers.\nI tell him that maybe he could have micromanaged more when the collapse started, sent out more notes, been more vocal. But even as I say it, I hedge, because I am not even sure that any of that would have worked. Cook shrugs and goes silent.\nNetherlands will make over 300 again in the next game. Ehsan will over-compensate for his swing again. Hong Kong try will try to execute the correct plan for opener Stephan Myburgh, but the bowlers won\'t follow through on it. On his whiteboard Cook will write, \"When you get in, go on and win the game\". Rath and Hayat will again make a big partnership but neither will bat through to the end. Nizakat will again thrill, and then get out well before his job is done. And Hong Kong will again struggle with their middle order, and their tail will again not be good enough to complete the win.\nThe game will remind me of something that Cook said after the first loss. \"We can say we are learning, but not if we keep making the same mistakes.\"\nHong Kong, the team with only three proper cricket grounds, have scored over 600 chasing over two games, but without that win, it feels like it\'s all for nothing.\nIn the second game, I notice one different thing from Cook. Hong Kong had managed to keep the Netherlands top order under pressure much better. Since they were batting too slow, you could sense they were going to attack when van der Merwe came in. Cook realised it after one attacking shot.\nThere are no quiet pauses this time. He is up and tells his 12th man to pass on the message: \"They are going to come at us hard, but if you can hang in there, two quick wickets might come and that will knock the stuffing out of them.\"\nBut just telling his 12th man isn\'t enough, so he runs over to a sweeper on the boundary and tells him too. Then he runs off and tells another sweeper the same message. If Cook could, he\'d tell them all.\nNetherlands do come hard, a chance is created, and it is dropped. The next over, a wicket is taken.  Cook just shrugs his shoulders and goes quiet again.\nJarrod Kimber is a writer for ESPNcricinfo. @ajarrodkimber\n © \nESPN Sports Media Ltd.\n    \n')[0m

She said the vehicles involved were two transit vans, a Nissan 4x4, a Fiat Panda, and a Hyundai Tucson.\n\nA tweet from the Derbyshire roads police team last night said: \"A623 Peak Forest. Serious injury RTC 1850 hrs. 4 vehicles involved. Any witnesses please phone 101 and quote incident 794 of 01/03/17.\"\n\n\n')[0m

The graceful giraffe appeared calm and collected as she picked at stray pieces of hay and stretched around to scratch a back itch. Watch it above.\nThe zoo, which unveiled April-inspired emojis and t-shirts as the fan base for the 15-year-old long-necked beauty continues to swell, said twin Barbados lambs and a Patagonian Cavy were born early Wednesday.\nNY Zoo Giraffe Stream Banned for \'Nudity\' Back After Outcry\n\"Babies babies everywhere!\" the Animal Adventure Park posted Wednesday morning. \"Just not yet in the giraffe barn.\"\nApril\'s pregnancy was catapulted into global headlines last week after YouTube briefly yanked the zoo\'s live stream following complaints by animal activists that it violated the site\'s policies concerning \"nudity and sexual content.\" Thousands upon thousands of commenters voiced their frustration on Facebook and YouTube, and the stream was restored within an hour or so.\nGiraffe pregnancies last for 15 months. Labor lasts anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Once April goes into active labor, zookeepers will go in to help her the rest of the way. The calf will be about 150 pounds and 6 feet tall at birth and up and walking in about an hour.\nThe zoo said it will hold an online competition to name the baby giraffe once it\'s born.\nUS-Born Panda Bao Bao Lands in China After Leaving DC Zoo\nPublished 2 hours ago\n')[0m

In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

He went to elementary and middle school in Hong Kong before moving to Dallas with his family, where he enrolled in Flower Mound High School.\nAnthony Tsang, described as mischievous yet lighthearted and giving by his loved ones, was the source of many hilarious stories and was known for his carefree, easygoing personality. Photo courtesy of Michelle Lew\nTiana Tsang, Anthony Tsang’s younger sister, said her brother did not care what others thought of him and \'was his own person\' who was willing to be friends with anyone.\nTiana Tsang said she never realized how generous her brother was while growing up, but as she reminisced, she realized how much he gave to her. She said Anthony Tsang saved up his allowance to buy her a stuffed animal panda that she wanted for her sixth birthday.\n\'He remembered that I wanted it, and he went back to buy it for me,\' she said. \'So it’s just like little things that I didn’t really think about at the time but now when I go back, it just really matters to me.\'\nTiana Tsang also said her brother was incredibly selfless and always looking out for others.\n\'After he passed away, a bunch of his friends came out with stories about him and a lot of things he did, I never knew about, and a lot of us never knew about, that showed how selfless he was,\' she said.\nMichelle Lew, Tony’s fiancée, said they did everything together.\n\'He was my best friend, the one I shared everything with,\' Lew said. \'Since the day we met, for two years, we only spent maybe a total of five nights apart.\'\nLew said Anthony could brighten anyone’s day and was able to connect with those around him through his diverse interests and cheerful personality.\n\'He was really, for lack of a better word, goofy. He was always messing around, always the silly one, trying to make people laugh,\' Lew said.\nLew and Anthony Tsang lived in Santa Barbara together after meeting on Tinder in San Jose two years ago. They owned two Jack-Russell-Chihuahua mixes and enjoyed going to Arroyo Burro Beach together with their dogs.\n\'The big thing that stuck out was how we met, because we actually met on Tinder. So that was a one-in-a-million thing,\' Lew said. \'The first thing that he messaged me was a pick up line, which was: ‘I’m looking for my next wife on Tinder.’\'\nLew said a year after they met, they were engaged and planned to marry after they finished college.\n\n\'Everything just fit together by random chance,\' Lew said.\nIn high school, Anthony Tsang was on the cross country team with his friend, Jonathan Wyatt. The two were friends all throughout high school.\nWyatt described Anthony Tsang as \'curious and mischievous ... but also extremely charismatic and caring for other people.\'\n\'It was quite an interesting combination … but it honestly made him a really fun person, and I enjoyed spending a lot of time with him,\' Wyatt said.\nWyatt said Anthony Tsang was always getting into trouble in high school and said once he and Anthony Tsang attempted to steal an old computer out of a shed on the high school campus.\nWyatt said even though the scheme was his idea, Anthony Tsang took most of the blame after they were caught.\n\'It was the most ridiculous thing ever, so funny,\' Wyatt said. \'And Tony was like, man, this always happens to me.\' It was great, and honestly I’d give anything just to relive those days again.\'\nWyatt said Anthony Tsang’s other friends would describe him as \'someone you could count on, no matter what it was.\'\n\'I think the fact that we could always count on him really was like one of the bigger takeaways from his personality because no matter what situation you were in ... he wasn’t really one to judge people,\' Wyatt said.\nWyatt also said he admired Anthony Tsang’s adventurous personality, which made a \'huge impact\' on his own high school experience.\n\'He never really had a stop button. It was always go go go,\' Wyatt said. \'It was very different from how most people live their life, I feel.\'\nTiana Tsang said her brother wanted to be a U.S. ambassador to Mexico because he \'really loved it.\'\nHe traveled to Mexico on vacation multiple times with Lew, and Anthony Tsang said he loved how \'nice\' and \'chill\' everyone was there.\nAccording to Lew, Anthony Tsang was a \'big beer enthusiast,\' which she said might have contributed to his love of Mexico.\n\'He liked ... just how everyone is so easygoing,\' Lew said. \'He liked just sitting on the beach and going in the ocean. He liked how friendly everyone was, just something about Mexico’s culture … he was comfortable there.\'\nLew and her fiancé traveled to Canada, Las Vegas and Mexico together. They planned to visit Hawaii and backpack through Europe.\nAnthony Tsang enjoyed listening to EDM, country and indie rock music and was a Dallas basketball and football fan. He liked to draw and snowboard and loved cars, especially Porsches.\n\'A couple weeks ago, we went to Porsche, and he was super excited because he got to test drive one,\' Lew said. \'We went back two days later for me to test drive cars, but then he test drove it again.\'\nTiana Tsang said her brother was always willing to try new things and lived a carefree life.\n\'He always wanted to experience life as much as possible, and I know it sounds really cheesy, but that’s honestly just the kind of person he was,\' Tiana Tsang said. \'And one thing that I really say is that, like, he really lived more life in his 23 years than some people do in their whole entire lives.\'\nA version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, March 2, 2017, print edition of the Daily Nexus.\nRelated\n')[0m

After consolidating its market leadership in China , NetEase Games is looking to expand further overseas. When discussing the overseas strategy for NetEase Games, NetEase CEO Ding Lei mentioned that he has ambitious goals to achieve greater results in the non-Chinese gaming markets within the next three to five years.\nTo show their dedication toward overseas markets, NetEase sent its dream team of lead developers for five flagship games to the event. This group consisted of Chen Junxiong of the mobile version of the NetEase classic Fantasy Westward Journey, Jin Tao of 2016 blockbuster Onmyoji, Yu Kai of the company\'s first virtual reality game Twilight Pioneers, Liu Xi of the mobile game adaptation of Hollywood animation film Kung Fu Panda 3, and Wang Xi of the upcoming 3D warfare MMO War Rage.\nThese five developers represent NetEase Games\' flagship titles and the highest quality of production that the company intends to bring to overseas markets. Early indications of global expansion have been very encouraging  Fantasy Westward Journey has over 100 million registered players worldwide; Twilight Pioneers was selected as among the first wave of releases on Google\'s virtual reality platform Daydream; Kung Fu Panda 3 was rated Google Play 2016 Top 10 Games in Korea; the Japanese version of Onmyoji was released last week and was number on the free download rankings.

The campaign aims to raise $1 million in March. (Pierson is the campaign\'s poster girl).\nNewswise - LOS ANGELES (March 1, 2017) – Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) launched its second annual Make March Matter™ campaign Wednesday. Longtime CHLA supporter Kim Kardashian West joined the hospital to kick off the campaign, which has attracted the commitment of more than 100 businesses in Los Angeles and the Coachella Valley. The month-long community fundraising drive is helping local businesses rally community participation to raise $1 million in the month of March to support children’s health in Los Angeles and surrounding communities.\n\'Make March Matter is a movement uniting companies and individuals to bring awareness to the healthcare needs of children and to maintain the programs and services at CHLA that address those needs,\' says Children’s Hospital Los Angeles president and CEO Paul Viviano. \'We are fortunate to have such a compassionate and loyal group of partners helping us to fulfill our mission of creating hope and building healthier futures for our patients and their families.\'\nEach year, CHLA treats children who face a broad range of health issues, from common illnesses to traumas to chronic diseases.

You speak about the defence industry. Who deals with China in this industry? We have Federal departments that businesses deal with. I wouldn’t let the council either speak for my business or run it. This is not your role. Sam, you and the other councillors are grandstanding in areas you have no expertise.”\nAnd Michael Webster suggested: “Show him a doco on pandas, there are plenty on YouTube, and let him visit Chaddy on his lunch break. Problem solved ...”\nThe mayor’s Facebook page attracted support as well as criticism, with some praising his efforts to attract investment.\nEvelyn Gansky posted: “The greatest amount of thought, planning and vision has gone into this possible deal. You do more on a daily basis than our so-called politicians. The Casey community should be eternally grateful.”\nThe visit will also take in Shanghai, Shuanghui County in Chengdu and the Longquanyi District in Chengdu.\nThe trip was mooted two years ago and Casey Council had hoped that businesses and neighbouring Cardinia councillors would join next month’s trip but a spokesman for the Cardinia said it was unnecessary for it to spend the money.\nCasey officers said business leaders had initially been interested until the trip was scheduled for the school holidays.\nThe City of Greater Dandenong is also investigating a trip to China.\nA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

The long, slow, often sun-soaked ride earned its nickname, The Couch.\nD.T.: Deep Temerity chairlift. The definition of \"temerity\" is excessive confidence, audacity, so someone or something with \"deep temerity\" is ... insane?\nSafety Gate: If a passenger fails to unload, their legs will contact a lightweight bar, line, or pass through a light beam which stops the lift. The lift operator will then help them disembark, reset the safety gate, and initiate the lift restart procedure.\nNumbers versus Names: On Ajax and Snowmass, lifties reference lifts by their lift numbers; Buttermilk and Highlands by their names. (Old people on Ajax refer to them by number, as well.)\nWhile each mountain in the Aspen Skiing Co. family has its unique ascent, there is something suspenseful about the trip up Aspen Highlands. The vibe at the gate on Exhibition lift this particular morning is relaxed. It\'s warm and sunny and The Stones are playing softly in the background. Always a brisk ride up, one sails over the treetops at 1,000 feet per minute, or 11.36 mph. The lift dumps out above the Merry-Go-Round Restaurant and after a quick skier\'s-right dash around the corner, one arrives at the Loge Peak lift, nestled in a wooded glade. The song \"Good Vibes\" by Rebellion reverberates loudly, courtesy of an extra speaker perched in the trees. The lift operator is grooving to the beat and the heart rate ticks up as buttocks meet chair. It\'s quiet again, save for the wind and the intermittent rumble of the towers before the hum of the top terminal arrives. Castle Creek sprawls out in all her glory below; the ridge of the mighty Highland Bowl looms above. Eat your hearts out, O Red Mountain overlords, these top-of-the-lift, corner-office views can\'t be bought.\nWe\'re all so concerned with going down the mountain, we often don\'t give much pause to the ride up — and the curious long-haired creatures who make sure we get there safely. These are the lift operators and lift attendants — or \"lifties,\" to use mountain parlance — who supply an essential service to the resort. On one hand, you could take away the instructors, the restaurants, the ticket office, even the ski patrol, and technically people could still go skiing. But with no one to run the lifts, except for maybe a few uphillers, the mountains would be empty. On the other hand, what on Earth do the lifties do all day besides press a button and watch people sit and stand?\n\"We\'re the most seen, least visible people on the mountain,\" explains Jesse, an Aspen native who works/DJs the No. 3 Lift (aka Ajax Express). In short, a lot is going on before the first skier/rider arrives on the hill. \"The No. 1 thing about this job is safety,\" notes Buttermilk lift manager Marianne Barrett. Mandated by the Colorado Passenger Tramway Safety Board, each lift and gondola runs through a rigorous safety protocol each morning before the lifts can operate. This includes everything from testing the phones that connects the top and bottom terminals to checking the tires on the detachable high-speed quads and running various tests on the haul rope to make sure it is performing as it should be to making sure the chairs are moving through the zones efficiently so they don\'t pile up (not to mention monitoring the engine, its power supply, the auxiliary diesel engine, checking the emergency brakes, gears, pulleys, belts and every detail right down to panda bear protocol — or simply keeping track of the big stuffed panda on Buttermilk and making sure it rides the lift alone; only the smaller stuffed panda is allowed to ride with the kids up the chair).\nOnce the lifts are up and running, the main job is to make sure everyone gets on and off safely. The intensity of this duty varies from lift to lift.  V.X. (aka Village Express at the bottom of Snowmass) requires no less than 10 lifties at a time to load an endless stream of beginners, whereas Five Trees at Aspen Highlands, which services AVSC, can get as few as 10 riders total. Over on the Silver Queen Gondola, the lifties are busy making sure everyone gets in and out of the cabins safely and comfortably. Maneuvering guests\' skies and boards in and out of those slots is an extra little amenity the lifties are happy to do.\n\'We’re the most seen, least visible people on the mountian.\'\n\"I mean, we have to one-up the service from those jerks at Vail,\" one such attendant confides shortly after handing the former first lady her skis.\nBut even on the most lackadaisical of lifts, attention must never waiver for more than a few seconds at a time. One never knows when something might go wrong. Tom, who works at the top of No. 4 (aka The Big Burn at Snowmass), recently had a little girl get her skis stuck. Her parents didn\'t realize what happened and so he ran out to help her. She was shaken and upset, but he quickly got her all settled, gave her the traditional \"everyone falls\" pep talk, and finished the deal with a fortuitous Valentine\'s Day lollipop he had tucked in his parka. \"She was so glad to see me,\" Tom explains. \"People don\'t realize how important customer service is to this job. You can\'t just be some silent dude in the background. It\'s really important to be able to get out there and make sure the guests feel safe and have a good time.\" Or as Marianne, Buttermilk\'s lift manager describes it, \"You have to be personable. You have to be friendly and you can\'t be afraid to touch people.\"\nApart from \"touching people,\" (appropriately, of course), the other defining challenge of being a lift operator is the cold. Luckily, Aspen gets a decent amount of sunshine; however, not all lifts get sun, and obviously, it gets damn cold plenty often. On a windy, cloudy day, just try standing out there with no skiing or boarding to get your blood going for eight minutes — much less eight hours — and you can start to imagine how insidious the plunging mercury can be. Put it this way, you will be dancing a gigue faster than you can hum, \"The snow is snowing. The wind is blowing.\"\nAnd then there is the boredom. Things do get slow, which leaves plenty of time to think.\n\"Yeah, sometimes too much time,\" laughs Maestro at the Deep Temerity lift. Rex, who works top of No. 9 (aka Sheer Bliss at Snowmass) reads the papers, does the crossword, sudoku, and then throws on a podcast — or four. Light reading and distractions are OK. Burying your nose in a page-turning novel, not OK. Outside, the attendants like to hit snow around, keeping busy with whatever they can — raking, shoveling, building steps.\n\"You start to master the three-second conversation,\" explains a different Tom, who works the Scooper Lift on Snowmass.\nAnother welcome distraction is something called \"chair marking.\" When someone is particularly nervous or had a rough embarkation, the bottom attendant will call up to the top to \"mark\" the chair. They also will mark particularly creative outfits — and particularly beautiful women.\n\"It\'s something to look forward to,\" blushes one top operator.\nFor some, it isn\'t the protocols, the cold, or the occasional boredom that gets to them, it is watching people ski all day. And this is the bittersweet — borderline sadomasochistic — aspect of the job: to be totally immersed, and yet once removed, from the sport that stirs their souls. You get paid to ski 100 days a year, but for most of those days, you are only getting a single run. One liftie admits that on powder days he won\'t even take it. \"It\'s just too painful to stop.\"\nThe powder day is example perfectus of the liftie paradox. What the rest of valley looks forward to with unbridled joy, the liftie anticipates with mixed feelings. \"We joke that you learn to hate powder days,\" explains Jesse on Ajax Express. \"But it\'s still nice to live vicariously.\" On Ajax, it\'s a 6:15 a.m. call time to help get all the gondola cabs back onto the haul line. They are removed at night during heavy snowfall so they don\'t get too weighed down. And then there are a good two hours of shoveling, raking, clearing out the maze (the lift lines), clearing out the lobster traps (the brightly colored gates that keep people from plowing into the crowd, as well as keeps the snow from piling up inside the maze.) Then again, a lot of the lifties get to enjoy a fresh track in the morning. At the very least, a nice ride down at the end of the day, not to mention the positive energy that reverberates from the mountainsides is an intoxicating and not altogether terrible work environment.\nPerhaps the most interesting aspect of the \"liftie life\" — as it were — is the unique culture that hatches every December at the base of the lifts. What used to be a bunch of ranchers and farmers who wanted to earn some extra money during the winter has evolved over the decades to become a calling in its own right, a sort of sub-subculture of the \"ski bum,\" a collection of mostly 20-something guys and a smattering of women who each imbue their lift or gondola with its own unique charms. The lifties at Summit Express at the base of Buttermilk work under their signature disco ball, loading 4-year-olds along with X Game acrobats who have just flung themselves into the air at similar launch vectors as the private jets 1,000 yards in the distance. Over on \"the Couch,\" one of the slowest rides around, the lifties enjoy its ample sunlight and en suite grill. Over at the Cloud Nine lift, famous for the DJing as much as the lift operating, it\'s always a joyous affair. The energy is amplified by Cloud Nine Restaurant patrons on their way to drink and dance with abandon.\nIf there is one leitmotif to the liftie culture — besides its fondess for long, Samson-esque locks and irreverent quotes scribbled on white boards — it is the music. It\'s something of a late-\'80s, classic rock echo chamber, a proclivity for which I was unable to source any particular rhyme or reason. The music is selected by the lifties, whoever feels like plugging in their phone, with only slight management oversight (no heavy swearing, nothing too crass or aggressive.) The music is simply what they like to listen to.\n\"My playlists happen over time,\" explains Lewis, who claims \"Planet Earth\" as home and works the Loge lift. He is particularly passionate about his tunes. Planet Earth? \"Yeah, yeah I moved around a lot growing up, but I also like that it puts everyone on the same level.\" When asked if he includes much top 40 in his playlists he winces, \"Um … no.\" His go-to genres include reggae, classic rock, funk and a bit of disco. \"The music a) keeps me going, and b) makes the guests happy.\"\nPerhaps there is no better display of liftie culture than at Customer Appreciation Day, every Wednesday on Highlands. Guests enjoy free parking, free coffee, free muffins and then at high noon precisely, the lifties at Deep Temerity serve up 80 freshly grilled hot dogs to a crowd of ravenously appreciative guests. In the eight years it has been going, four minutes is the record for selling out. The Deep Temerity lift could very well be nicknamed \"The Locals\' Lift.\" Servicing the Bowl and acres of gorgeous double-diamond terrain, it\'s no wonder it draws a certain devout fan base. Dave, an Aspen local who moved here in 1962, has been skiing \"D.T.\" seven days a week since it opened, usually eight to 12 runs a day, depending on how many bowl laps. When asked if he skies anywhere else, he responded with zero irony, \"Sure, I skied Snowmass once this season.\"\nAlmost all the lifts have their regulars and there is a certain family vibe that is created, not only among the lifties but between the guests, as well. One passes by in but a fleeting second, but somehow that little bond can form. Which isn\'t to say it\'s all peaches and cream in the liftie world. They spend all morning getting a lift open for a powder day and then get plenty of nasty looks when the snow hasn\'t been swiped off the chair. Not to mention that there\'s a hierarchy on the mountain and the lifties are pretty much at the bottom.\n\"They assume you\'re a pothead, a lazy ski bum, but a lot actually goes into this job that people don\'t see,\" one liftie confesses.\n\"It\'s the lowest paid but the most essential,\" argues Jason Leadman, a lift manager at Highlands.\nSo does a passing \"thank you\" lift their spirits?\n\"I never get sick of hearing the word thank you,\" Lewis replies, \"it\'s always a nice thing to hear.\"\nAside from gripes about pay and a respect gap, there is an overwhelming sense of pride, responsibility and joy among the liftie set.\n\"We work for a pretty badass company. The perks are small, but good,\" admits Tom on the Big Burn.\nHis friend Rex just over on Sheer Bliss makes the obvious comparison, \"I mean, the name says it all. Great view, great commute. It\'s very peaceful up here.\" Granted, at that exact moment it was a whiteout and the wind was howling, but you get the point. Spending time around the lifts, watching chair after chair after chair after chair roll by like waves crashing on a snowy beach, the hypnotic, almost spiritual nature of the job starts to emerge. Indeed, there is something monastic in the life of the liftie. Accepting the position isn\'t quite a vow of poverty, but not terribly far off. After all, it is a life committed if not to God, than to God\'s country, and all its pleasures be they ripped, fermented or smoked.\nIf there is a simple \"truth\" to the liftie life it was pointed out to me by Fernanda, who is on a J-1 visa from Costa Rica and works the Village Express at Snowmass. For all the hassles and hurdles of the ski vacation, and all the sacrifices of the ski life, it all melts away the moment you rush out in between the chairs. \"Everyone is happy when they are getting on the lift,\" she observes. And that, as they say, is the truth.\nDavid Stillman Meyer is a writer and graphic designer. Reach him at stillman-meyer.com.\nJoin the Conversation\n')[0m

This comes at a time when the State government is protesting the drastic reduction in inflow into Hirakud Dam Reservoir (HDR)  after Chhattisgarh Government constructed a series of barrages to harvest water.\nThe additional spillway at Hirakud dam was proposed after the Central Water Commission (CWC) recommended to enhance the flood water discharge capacity of all the major dams by 1.5 times of the current capacity.\nThe World Bank has even agreed to provide Rs 350 crore for the construction of the proposed spillway under the Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP).\nCurrently, there are 98 gates, including 64 sluice gates and 34 crest gates, to discharge flood water from the dam. The existing capacity to discharge the flood water from 98 gates is 15 lakh cusecs. However, it has been proposed to increase the flood water discharge capacity of the dam to 24 lakh cusecs which is why, the spillway has been proposed.\nWhile the team of Geological Survey of India (GSI) identified the location of spillway on the left dyke of the Hirakud dam, environmentalists doubt the additional spillway will be of any help.\nAccording to reports, the additional spillway is being constructed for release of flood waters from HDR. Water activist Ranjan Panda said that had the State Government planned long canals to divert water to irrigation fields or reservoirs built at a distance, it could have sold flood water to industries.\nRaising doubts over the government intention behind the spillway, Panda alleged that the State Government  is actually planning to help carry water to industries.\nHe said if the Government is serious about flood control, it should  invest in catchment protection, checking floodwaters and most importantly, increasing forest cover. \"When the State Government is unable to recover thousands of crores of water taxes and fines from defaulting industries, why should they go for World Bank loans to build such infrastructures whose impacts are doubtful,\" he questioned.\n')[0m

Pointing out that there are areas, including roads with potholes, dark spots, sewer system and rain drains, which warrant much more attention than beautifying rich colonies they claimed most of the work is taken up as the financial year is nearing its end when the MLA funds (Rs 14 crore) if left unutilised will go waste. \"MLAs are rushing to finish their allotted Rs 14 crore each funds in unnecessary schemes and spending money in beautification of colony gates, putting up swings in rich colonies, expensive mast lights, duplicating things and putting 20 benches in small park,\" said VK Arora, convener, Delhi Residents Forum. \"Both ruling as well as opposition party MLAs are working as per their own whims, with the latter mostly appeasing the RSS dominated colonies and the former making their pockets happy,\" he alleged while adding that in all this RWAs are not kept in the loop – something that has left them disgruntled unlike during the Sheila Dikshit regime when \"bhagidari system\" allowed them some scope. \"Many are losing their playgrounds and other utility facilities due to unwanted installations and spending on things, like fixing of welcome boards, installation of mast lights at already lit areas, relaying of pavements already in good condition, putting too many benches in small parks, installing iron gates in narrow streets further narrowing entry,\" noted M M Mehra, another RWA member. Arora claimed that in East Delhi at the direction of BJP MLA O P Sharma in pavement of a park which was already in \"good condition\" was changed in Karan Vihar, a colony of 100 residents, more than 10 benches were installed in a park against wishes of colony children as installation of benches has ended their playground.\n')[0m

Tribune Photo: Mukesh Aggarwal\nAnanya Panda\nTribune News Service\nNew Delhi, February 28\nUp in arms against what they call ‘muzzling of dissent\' and ‘ultra nationalism\', students, alumni and teachers of Delhi University and JNU, among others, joined in large numbers the ‘Save DU\' campaign called by Left-leaning student groups today. There were students from across the colleges of DU espousing the cause of the \"right to debate and dissent\" with many students arguing that the Ramjas College incident could have been an opportunity to question JNU student Umar Khalid, who is embroiled in a sedition case. \"It is (Ramjas violence and threats to Gurmehar) so scary. There is no point of having debates around democracy when there is so much intolerance. Universities have to have space for divergent views and violence is no way the answer differences in ideologies,\" said two students from Lady Shri Ram College. Losing civility is not the answer, said another protestor, even as she maintained that the fight should not be seen as one between two student factions but one against \"oppression and suppression of our right to disagree\". Another student, Kajal Bisht, who had come from South Campus, too blamed the ABVP for the entire Ramjas episode and said it must refrain from \"politics of muscle power\". Expressing solidarity to the cause, an alumna of both DU and JNU said \"The ultra nationalism that has started is horrifying. Such violence is not acceptable. What ABVP men are doing is not student politics but henchmen politics. Voices can\'t be throttled,\" she said. There were slogans, such as \"masculine politics not acceptable\", which echoed in the campus almost the entire day. However, the RSS-backed ABVP tried to distancing itself from the entire issue when it claimed the violence at DU\'s Ramjas College was provoked by \"outsiders\" whom it called \"anti-nationals\".\n')[0m

Enabling IoT network technology such as Cellular LPWA, together with cloud-based solutions, give manufacturing firms access to more information than ever before,\' said Ch', 'Thursday, March 2, 2017\nM2M News\nChina Mobile and Ericsson delivers successful trial of world’s first cellular IoT-based connected factory\nAshish Sharma |  New Delhi |  02 Mar 2017\nChina Mobile and Ericsson share outcomes of its ongoing Connected Factory trial using Cellular IoT for Industry 4.0 working with Intel. The trial, featuring a connected screw driver among other tools, took place at Ericsson Panda Communication Company (a radio product manufacturing site and an independent subsidiary of Ericsson) in Nanjing. The outcomes of the trial are highlighted in a demonstration at Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona.\nSeveral low power, wide area (LPWA) use cases are currently being implemented in the factory, such as production line monitoring, warehouse monitoring and package and materials tracking. The centerpiece of the demonstration to be shown in Barcelona is the connected high-precision screwdriver, with motion sensors attached to NB-IoT modules that transmit real-time data of the tools to the Cellular IoT network.\nThe demonstration is an end-to-end solution, covering terminals, networks to the platform, and analytics aspects. The setup consists of Ericsson‘s multi-mode radio equipment with new software supporting NB-IoT, Intel\'s pre-commercial software supporting NB-IoT, the Intel XMM 7115 modem solution embedded in Fibocom\'s module, as well as China Mobile\'s OneNet IoT platform with its software development kit (SDK).\nThere are about 1000 high-precision screwdrivers in the factory which require routine calibrations and lubrications based upon the amount of usage, all of which are recorded manually on paper today. With Connected Screwdrivers, the factory will be able to replace manual tracking of the tool usage data with an automated solution. Also, by connecting the tools over the Cellular IoT network, intelligent analysis of the collected data allows for optimized maintenance. The resulting benefits include a longer lifespan of the tools and reduction of human errors during operations. Screwdrivers with motion sensors attached to NB-IoT modules means that the factory will be able to automate the usage tracking of the screwdrivers.\n\"The combination of Cellular IoT and Industry 4.0 has so far been fairly unexplored. Enabling IoT network technology such as Cellular LPWA, together with cloud-based solutions, give manufacturing firms access to more information than ever before. The opportunity to use data to increase productivity is not only beneficial to a firm, but the whole of society as well,\" said Chris Houghton, Head of Region North East Asia of Ericsson.\n\"Intel is a leading 3GPP Release 13 standardization contributor, developing a Release 13 Narrow Band IoT (i.g. CAT-NB1) based solution with the Intel XMM 7115 modem chipset. Intel will work with China Mobile and infrastructure companies to enable NB-IOT fast commercial deployment as we advance toward a 5G future,\" said Weng Kuan Tan, Vice President and General Manager of Intel\'s Client Computing Group China.\nChina Mobile is committed to accelerating the development of Cellular IoT technology and its ecosystem. On the one hand, China Mobile leads the incorporation and unification of NB-IoT standards by completing world\'s first lab testing on NB-IoT and making large-scale field trials and application exploration, in order to research   Cellular IoT networking schemes and facilitate fast maturation of end-to-end products; on the other hand, it originates the establishment of 5G Joint Innovation Center by uniting cross-industry and cross-region industry partners as well as international organizations, such as GTI and GSMA, builds open labs, makes business and  product innovation, promotes 5G networking cost reduction, and build dynamic, innovative, mutually beneficial and value sharing industry ecosystem.\n\"Ericsson is dedicated to helping operator customers around the world embrace the opportunities of IoT, 5G and Cloud. With our global leadership and experience in IoT standardization and applications, we will work hand in hand with China Mobile to realize the full potential of the Networked Society,\" added Chris Houghton.\n')[0m

Play Along. Learn through trial and error. Stay on the learning curve. Perhaps then, you’ll be able to differentiate what works and what doesn’t.\nHowever, if you want a shortcut, check out these 5 tried and tested tips, which ensure that Google robots play along, no matter what.\n1. Build buyer personas, then nail them with your Naturaltongue\nNaturaltongue?\nUmm… folks, if there could be Parseltongue, why not Naturaltongue, huh?\nParseltongue for snakes. Naturaltongue for Google RankBrain AI. Simple.\nBut then, what’s this Buyer Persona?\nAh, yes! That calls for some explanation!\nAccording to the Content Marketing Insitute , content marketer’s build buyer persona’s by picturising their actual customers in terms of their age, job title, the company they are working for, the challenges and frustrations they are facing every single day, in addition to whether or not they are an authority decision maker.\nOnce you have a clearer picture on who your actual audience is, start communicating with them in your natural voice.\nBuilding a target audience, bearing in mind the buyer persona, helps businesses take the bull by the horns. Put simply, it helps address the problems of your target audience, more precisely. Makes sense… nah?\nTake, for instance, a site called wickedgoodies.com . The site has on display an amazing array of cake recipes, trade show tips, cake books on Amazon, video ebooks and so much more, all focussing on cakes, in addition to some great online marketing tips.\nLooking at the site, you’d realize the owner of this site knows their online visitors thoroughly – inside out, and has optimized their website accordingly.\nSo, when a customer, say someone called Suzanne, who runs a brick and mortar cake shop, is desperately looking for some tips to accelerate her online sales and Google’s ‘ Tips to promote cake online,’   she immediately stumbles on Wicked Goodies.\nHow come, you may ask?\nIt’s partly because Google’s RankBrain immediately figures out what Suzanne really wants and the RankBrain application intelligence robots rightly interpret ‘online’ as ‘internet’, and ‘tips’ as ‘strategies,’  thus returning high-quality results for Suzanne’s long tail search query.\nRankBrain AI is programmed to give better search results for complex and long-tail searches.\nNow, Suzanne could build on this info to make sure that her brick and mortar business not only survives but gives a tough competition to its competitors.\nKey takeways\nBuild a buyer persona and narrow down your target audience by sticking to it.\nFind what’s troubling your target audience, and then address those pain points in your natural language.\nUse related keywords (mind you, not the exact keywords). This could include synonyms, and co-occurrence (more on this in a minute) while offering solutions.\nCome up with creative blogs that immediately grab your user’s attention\nDesign products and services that address customer requirements\n2. Refer to Google’s crawl error report to spot gaps\nAs it turns out, for your site to feature in top searches, Google robots need to crawl your site, first and foremost.\nBut then, there are a few things to consider to ensure that Google doesn’t miss your site, in the first place.\nFirst off, make sure you are using accurate status codes on your site.\nFor example, use 301 redirects, instead of 302 redirects. Why you may ask? Well, because a 302 redirect is not at all programmed to inform Google robots that a particular page has been moved.\nAlso, consult Google’s crawl error report. The report keeps you covered in terms of gaps in your code, which perhaps is preventing Google robots from crawling your website properly.\nPlus, you can also block certain pages from being crawled using robots.txt. As you know, every site has a crawl budget and blocking images that are not that important, which ensures you have some spare budget in hand for really important pages.\nKey takeaway:\nUse 301 redirects, instead of 302 redirects\n')[0m

Photo: AP/Adelaide Zoo/Brian Charlton\nFu Ni underwent artificial insemination in October last year, and last week her hormone levels indicated she might have been preparing to give birth.\nBut the zoo says while she went through a \'pseudo-labour\' over the weekend, including contractions and heavy breathing, the time has now passed for her to have delivered a baby.\nSenior panda keeper Simone Davey says her team had been treating Fu Ni as though she was pregnant but were never able to confirm a cub.\n\'During a pseudo pregnancy, hormonal changes and behaviours are identical to those of a true pregnancy, making it very difficult to determine if a giant panda is actually pregnant or not,\' she said.\n\'The only definitive way to confirm pregnancy in pandas is through a comprehensive ultrasound examination where a foetus can be seen in the last few weeks of a pregnancy.\n\'While Fu Ni has allowed us to ultrasound her for short periods, and the ultrasounds showed some swelling of the uterus and placenta thickening, we weren’t able to confirm a foetus.\'\nSince going through the pseudo labour Fu Ni has adopted a toy and spends the day cradling and holding it close to her chest.\nDavey says such behaviour is expected and keepers will continue to monitor her closely and eventually help her to move on from the toy.\nZoos SA chief executive Elaine Bensted says despite the lack of success during the most recent breeding season, officials still have hopes that Fu Ni will become a mother at some stage.\n\'We have always known that breeding the Southern Hemisphere’s only giant pandas was going to be incredibly challenging,\' she said.\n– AAP\nJump to next article Will my comment be published?

She incorporates both nature and realism in her artworks; consistently conveying strong messages through the ethereal beauty of these two concepts.\n\n\n‘Melancholy-a girl called depression\' is no different. For those who have never experienced depression, it can be an obscure feeling of dejection, yet Ingelosi perfectly captivates it with her own personification of the condition. The character in the series comes without a head, and sans arms in a few of the photographs. It depicts the feeling of hopelessness and emptiness; having almost nothing left of her to go on-explaining the reason behind the character\'s legs remaining attached throughout the series.\n\n\nRegardless of the hike in awareness of mental illnesses, many who suffer from it would rather hide in its shadows than to have a voice for themselves. Ingelosi is hopeful her photo series will help as a stepping stone for those who are afraid to seek help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[via  Bored Panda , images via Cheeky Ingelosi Photography ]\nReceive interesting stories like this one in your inbox\nAdvertise here\n')[0m

In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

This allow users to upload and engage with video content based on their interest, while connecting with like-minded individuals both regionally and globally.\nFollowing the rapid rise in demand for online video content, the site was born when Acer and Stefan often found their friends posting videos of their passion, whether it be cycling or wakeboarding, on other social networks were met with a complete lack of interest. This led the pair to create HighlyRated.com, where users are encouraged to Rate or Hate videos based on their merit. Videos that are then the most ‘rated\' will appear on the site\'s homepage, providing the user with higher visibility and connectivity.\nCommenting on HighlyRated.com\'s launch, Co-Founder and CEO Acer Jamal said, \"Beta testing of the site was beyond positive – even with very optimistic expectations, we\'re delighted with the response so far. Having lived in the UAE on & off for over 20 years, we chose to launch our Middle East office here in UAE due to its reputation as a hub for entrepreneurship. The Middle East is our focus before we expand outward, instead of the other way round, which has been the case with nearly every other social network.\"\nUsers are now encouraged to sign up for the video-based social network by visiting www.HighlyRated.com .

Since its launch last year, numerous graphic designers, printers and publishers have made the switch to PERGRAPHICA® design papers – and are delighted by the results.\nKnown as ‘Paper for Perfectionists’, PERGRAPHICA® fulfils the most demanding requirements for sophisticated and elegant printed documents while meeting top sustainability standards. The portfolio provides excellent printability on a choice of textures, shades and weights. It is available in two textures (Rough and Smooth), three shades (High White, Classic and Natural) and six grammages between 90 and 300 g/m2. Customers in many European countries can purchase PERGRAPHICA® through local distribution companies.\nJohannes Klumpp, Marketing and Sales Director, Mondi Uncoated Fine Paper, said, \'We are pleased by PERGRAHICA®’s quick success on the market and the wonderful feedback we’ve received from customers. It shows how well this portfolio suits the needs of the creative industries. With its look and feel, PERGRAPHICA® reflects emotions that bring your story to life.\'\nMore customer focused than you expect. Every day.\nPERGRAPHICA® is FSC® certified, making it the logical choice of paper for the Forest Stewardship Council Germany’s 2016 magazine. Dr Uwe Sayer, Managing Director of FSC Germany, stated, \'As an international certification organisation, we make sure to use paper that bears our certification and further fulfils high environmental standards. With PERGRAPHICA® paper we could give our FSC magazine a distinctly higher value, which was immediately accessible to each reader and about which we have received numerous positive reader comments.\'\nThe Lokay printing house was responsible for printing the 2016 FSC Germany magazine. They used PERGRAPHICA® Natural Smooth in 300 g/qm for the cover and 150 g/qm for the inside pages. It was a positive experience, reported Thomas Fleckenstein of Druckerei Lokay: \'The large format colour images and full colour images came out very well despite the open, natural surfaces. The paper dried very quickly and could be handled after a short time. Thanks to an above average bulk of 1.3, the magazine achieved very high-value haptics – so our customer was impressed by more than just the visual effect.\'\nThe Italian print magazine Digitalic has chosen PERGRAPHICA® for the cover production. Francesco Marino, Digitalic’s founder and director, most appreciates the freedom that it allows for different printing technologies. He commented, \'PERGRAPHICA® gives us the freedom to do almost anything. Our magazine covers use different printing processes, and PERGRAPHICA® maintains its qualities unchanged even after very different finishes. The creative level is a great advantage for us, as we can envisage anything for our covers and produce it, knowing that the paper will best realise our vision.\'\nThe Austrian magazine PRINT & PUBLISHING used PERGRAPHICA® for its Summer 2016 edition. They chose to print on High White Smooth for the cover and Classic Rough for the inside pages. Michael Seidl, Managing Editor of the magazine, considered the outcome a success: \'We could not be more impressed by the haptics, the satiny surfaces and the unbelievably high quality of the photo reproduction. We’ve also had positive feedback from our readers and advertising customers. The printing house and printers we used for the project likewise spoke positively about the papers’ printability.\'\nSince its launch, PERGRAPHICA® has won the admiration of many Russian designers and printers, who spoke of their positive experiences at the business breakfast event in October, organized by Double V and Mondi (A full report from the event can be found on the Facebook page of Russian distribution company Double V.). Demonstrating that the applications of PERGRAPHICA® are limitless, is the project of the designer Marina Adamova, who designed the photo sets for Avon’s advertising campaign in Russia. She found that unprinted PERGRAPHICA® makes the perfect backdrop for product photo shoots. She cited two reasons: its strength and flexibility make it perfect for cutting and folding by hand, and only this paper produces the correct shadows. Her Avon winter set images can be viewed at http://www.talamaskanka.com/avon-winter-set\nThe world-famous Bolshoi Theatre of Russia is another satisfied customer of PERGRAPHICA® Yury Tikhonov, Director of the Bolshoi Theatre printing house, said, \'The paper we have chosen for the Bolshoi programmes reflects how we interact with the audience. Here, PERGRAPHICA® is a unique paper. It does not only share emotions, visualise images and promote creativity and inspiration, but enhances the status and highlights the best traditions of the theatre as well. The paper proves perfect in printing, aside from its splendid performance. This is truly the paper for perfectionists! With PERGRAPHICA® we never doubt the result.\'\nLocal distribution partners add to customer convenience\nMondi uses a network of distribution partners to sell PERGRAPHICA® in certain European markets. Customers can obtain samples and place orders through their local paper merchant. In many European countries clients can obtain samples and purchase PERGRAPHICA® through local distribution companies. In central and eastern Europe, it is sold through Europapier. It is available in Germany from Paper Union, in Italy from Burgo Distribuzione, and in Russia from Double V.\nInnovative and flexible qualities\nMondi left no stone unturned in developing PERGRAHPICA® as a premium design paper. To ensure optimal colour reproduction, Mondi worked with X-rite, the industrial leader in colour management systems and has developed specific ICC profiles and CxF files for the PERGRAPHICA® range.\nAs a hybrid printing paper, PERGRAPHICA® works well with all printing technologies. It delivers consistent, high-quality results for both offset and digital printing, as well as excellent haptics thanks to its above-average bulk. It is also well-suited to a variety of post-print processing such as cellophaning, embossing, creasing, die-cutting and more. PERGRAPHICA® is available in standard folio formats 64x90 cm SG/LG, 72x102 cm SG/LG and other folio formats upon request.\nSustainable. Every day.\n PERGRAPHICA® is a Mondi Green Range product – one of many that support customers in going green. It is FSC® certified for responsible forestry, bears the EU’s Ecolabel and is produced exclusively in an ISO 14001-certified mill. It is also the only design paper brand included in the WWF’s ‘Check Your Paper’ resource for third-party audited, environmentally friendly pulp and paper products (checkyourpaper.panda.org).\nMore information about PERGRAPHICA® design papers is available at\nwww.mondigroup.com/PERGRAPHICA\n')[0m

You watch and go: Is that Gene Steratore?\"\nSteratore is humble but embraces being called the Deion Sanders of his profession, aka \"Prime Time.\"\n\"Prime is here!\" he tells an old friend working security.\nSteps from the court, a boy offers him a slice of pizza. Steratore just smiles. And then he whispers a line that reflects the joy he brings to his job: \"They pay us to do this.\"\nIn truth, this is not easy money. Basketball officials can be required to make a half-dozen decisions on each of 120 to 140 plays over 40 minutes, and TV viewers and overheated observers expect them to get every call right.\nDid the player travel? Who initiated contact? Was there displacement? Was the defender\'s foot in the restricted zone? Was there continuation? When did the shot clock sound?\nAnd perhaps most difficult of all: How do you keep your cool when a powerful and sometimes physically intimidating coach is blasting you?\n\"When chaos is erupting in our arena and fans are going crazy,\" Steratore says, \"we have to be the calming force.\"\nLast month the Big Ten gave the Tribune rare access, allowing a reporter to embed with officiating crews at the Rutgers - Purdue and Maryland -Northwestern games, shadowing them before, during and after games — plus while their boss scrutinized their calls at the Big Ten command center.\nA summary of what we learned: By the time officials take the floor, they are hours into their workday, having iced, stretched and studied each team. They walk, jog or run as many as 2.5 miles per game. Some work nearly 100 nights from November to March — and they razz each other about their heavy schedules. They can make upward of $3,000 per game but have to pay for their flights, hotels and rental cars. They hunger for an invitation to work the NCAA tournament. They miss about 4.2 calls over 40 minutes.\nNuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune\nGene Steratore (left) and Mike Eades in their locker room before officiating the Northwestern-Maryland game at Welsh-Ryan Arena on Feb. 15, 2017.\nGene Steratore (left) and Mike Eades in their locker room before officiating the Northwestern-Maryland game at Welsh-Ryan Arena on Feb. 15, 2017.\n(Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune)\nAnd, contrary to some perceptions, the best officials try to avoid issuing technical fouls.\nRick Boyages, who oversees basketball officiating for the Big Ten, says of Steratore: \"Gene can take a coach in a most heated state and disarm him in five seconds. It\'s a real skill.\"\nThe best example came Jan. 20, 2015, when more than 17,000 fans packed the Kohl Center to watch two ranked teams — Iowa and Wisconsin — duke it out in an ESPN prime-time game.\nBadgers coach Bo Ryan, who rode the officials harder than anyone in the conference, confronted Steratore over a call and began cussing him out. Steratore approached Ryan and told him: \"Look at me. Here\'s how you do this.\"\nSteratore put his left hand over his mouth: \"Now you can mother-(bleep) me!\"\nRyan chuckled, cursed some more. A university photographer captured the moment.\n\"Look how fun this is!\" Steratore told Ryan. \"They don\'t know what we\'re doing.\"\nBo Ryan\nBryce Richter / University of Wisconsin-Madison\nWisconsin coach Bo Ryan talks with referee Gene Steratore during a Jan. 20, 2015 game against Iowa at the Kohl Center.\nWisconsin coach Bo Ryan talks with referee Gene Steratore during a Jan. 20, 2015 game against Iowa at the Kohl Center.\n(Bryce Richter / University of Wisconsin-Madison)\nMackey Arena, West Lafayette, Ind., Feb. 14, one hour before tipoff\nThe three-man crew is in the officials\' locker room preparing for Rutgers-Purdue. Steratore is stretching on a towel. Larry Scirotto is icing his right ankle. Bo Boroski is applying Flexall, a pain-relieving gel, to his legs. It smells like Bengay, which, ESPN analyst Dan Dakich jokes, \"they buy in tubs.\"\nBoroski, 41, is 6-foot-4, a former pitcher at UAB who began reffing soccer, baseball and basketball as an 11-year-old in Tifton, Ga. His payment was five bucks and \"all you can eat at the concession stand,\" where the hot dogs were \"like crayons.\"\nHis father, whom he calls \"the original Bo,\" was a baseball umpire who taught him professionalism.\n\"I have Italian blood in me,\" he says, \"so I have to shave right before every game. If I were to shave at lunch and we had overtime, I would be scruffy.\"\nHe has seen Pearl Jam perform 37 times, and before calling a game at Welsh-Ryan Arena, he quickly scans the arena in hopes of spotting Evanston native and Cubs fan Eddie Vedder.\nScirotto, 43, is a self-described \"LA Fitness addict\" with a beach body that would attract gawkers in Santa Monica. He works out every morning not only to hone his 32-inch waist and Mike Tyson biceps, but also to set an example at his day job.\nScirotto became a police officer in Pittsburgh at 19. He was too young to legally own a gun, so his mother kept it locked in the house overnight. He has since risen to a supervisory role as assistant chief but says, \"I\'ve been ducking bullets for 20 years that have real consequences.\"\nLast month in Iowa City, Hawkeyes coach Fran McCaffrey got so enraged over the lack of a delay-of-game technical on Maryland, he charged toward Scirotto after the clock hit zeroes.\nScirotto was nonplussed as he exited the floor.\n\"Move,\" he told the Iowa coach. \"Move.\"\nOne Big Ten coach who preferred to remain anonymous praised Scirotto as \"having a good personality; he likes to crack jokes and keep it light.\"\nBoyages wants his refs to chitchat with players and coaches before games.\n\"They need to see them as human,\" Boyages says. \"If (Caleb) Swanigan finds out Larry is a cop, maybe that\'s something they\'d talk about.\"\nTribune reporter Shannon Ryan ranks the Big Ten men\'s basketball teams through the action of Feb. 26, 2017.\n(Shannon Ryan)\nAbout 50 minutes before tip, six members of Purdue\'s game-day staff enter the room. They include a \"TOC\" (timeout coordinator) who communicates with a producer in the TV truck and a \"tech\" who serves as a replay technician.\n\"How \'bout the clocks, boys, any problems in the last two weeks?\" Steratore asks.\nTold no, Steratore delivers a pep talk: \"The ego we will show on the court will only be for self-preservation. There is nothing stupid about any question you could possibly ask. We want to get it right.\"\nBoroski examines the game ball, which varies by school depending on the apparel contract. Wisconsin uses a little-known brand from Puyallup, Wash., named Sterling, perhaps giving the Badgers a small advantage.\nBefore leaving for the court, one of the game-day staff members jokes to the officials: \"I\'ve never seen you guys mess up.\"\nSteratore responds: \"When I work a perfect game, I\'ll quit. I will never duplicate it.\"\nTipoff, Feb. 14\nSixteen seconds in, Scirotto blows his whistle for an unusual call. Purdue guard Carsen Edwards receives a pass after getting freed by a double screen. But Edwards stepped out of bounds while moving without the ball.\n\"An offensive foul down low,\" play-by-play man Jeff Levering says on the Big Ten Network broadcast. \"Rutgers forcing an early turnover.\"\nScirotto blows his whistle for an unusual call\nAn unusual call early in the Rutgers-Purdue game. (Courtesy of the Big Ten Conference)\nAn unusual call early in the Rutgers-Purdue game. (Courtesy of the Big Ten Conference)\nSee more videos\nActually it\'s a violation, but a borderline one. Officials call this the \"Gary Harris Rule\" in honor of the former Michigan State guard who liked to come off screens from behind the basket, creating sharp angles to lose defenders.\nBut it\'s called only when the player is the first to receive a pass after leaving the court of his own volition. And in this case, a Rutgers defender might have nudged Edwards out.\n\"That\'s the dumbest thing,\" Purdue coach Matt Painter tells Boroski as he walks past.\nIn an interview with the Tribune the next day, Painter says: \"It\'s not a good rule. Our guy barely went out of bounds, and one of their guys impeded his progress.\"\nPurdue has beasts in Swanigan and Isaac Haas, and they sometimes play overlapping minutes. There\'s so much grappling inside, Painter says, \"we can be tough to officiate.\"\nIndeed, late in the first half, Painter hollers at Steratore: \"Hold! He can\'t grab him, Gene.\"\nSteratore warns Painter that Haas has to \"get out\" of the lane to avoid a three-second violation.\n\"Any time we can preventively officiate and stay out of this game,\" Steratore says, \"we will do it.\"\nHalftime, Feb. 14\nIn their locker room, Scirotto downs some chocolate-covered espresso beans. Steratore drinks a Coke and talks about his interaction with Painter.\n\"Getting your plays right, that\'s not really hard at this level if you\'re good enough to be here,\" he says. \"Most of what we do is managing the game.\"\nIt\'s an even greater part of his football work.\n\"A play lasts six seconds with 20 seconds of downtime,\" he says. \"Imagine an individual having to play so violently for six seconds and then having to be normal for 20. And then violent for six more. How do you take that emotion and keep him mentally stable in between the violence?\"\nSecond half, Feb. 14\nBefore play resumes, Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell chats with Boroski, telling him he\'s at a loss as to how to defend Purdue\'s \"bigs.\"\nBoroski is cordial but does not chime in, explaining later: \"When (a coach) goes down that road, we can\'t let our guard down. Can\'t give a quotable line that can be used against us later. I listen and acknowledge, but I don\'t agree, disagree or add my own input.\"\nPurdue leads 35-31 with 18:35 to play. Rutgers 7-footer C.J. Gettys is defending the massive Swanigan and grinding his right forearm into Swanigan\'s back. The low-post defender is permitted to keep it there, but Gettys twice uses the forearm to jab. No call.\n\"C\'mon, Bo!\" Painter yells.\n\'C’mon, Bo!\' Painter yells\nBo Boroski opts not to call a foul on Rutgers\' C.J. Gettys. (Courtesy of the Big Ten Conference)\nBo Boroski opts not to call a foul on Rutgers\' C.J. Gettys. (Courtesy of the Big Ten Conference)\nSee more videos\nRutgers does not attempt a free throw until 37 minutes have passed, but Pikiell has no outward complaint. Purdue is the better team, and the officials have worked a smooth game.\nAbout the only thing that goes wrong comes when Steratore tries to toss his gum into a trash can and misses. He jokingly signals for a hacking foul.\nWith 30 seconds to play and the clock running, Boroski notices Rutgers walk-on Jake Dadika trying to check into the game. But Rutgers has no timeouts.\nBoroski asks Painter: \"Hey, can I get him in?\"\nPainter has no vested interest but complies. A nice gesture by Painter and good awareness by Boroski.\n\"That\'s why he\'s Bo,\" Steratore says.\nPostgame, Feb. 14\nBoyages huddles with the officials, praising them for a clean game. Over the next 12 to 18 hours, he will grade every foul, every violation and plays when perhaps a foul or violation should have been called. Correct calls get a \"1,\" wrong calls get a \"2\" and he tags 50-50 calls with a question mark.\nThe Big Ten logs and charts everything. Through the first 146 games, Boyages determined officials missed 620 calls, 4.24 per game. That number is down slightly over the past few seasons. The average game has 2.6 \"50-50\" calls.\nThe only clearly missed call at Purdue came when Gettys was defending Swanigan in the low post. Boyages and Boroski analyze the replay on an iPad.\nBoyages: \"Looks like pop … pop.\"\nBoroski: \"Is it displacement?\"\nBoyages: \"Well, (Swanigan) is 300 pounds. So it\'s probably going to take more.\"\nBoroski: \"That\'s what I was thinking.\"\nBoyages: \"But what level of a crack is it?\"\nBoyages: \"You can talk him through that: \'32, you can use the arm bar, but don\'t be popping him in the back. I\'m not going to call a foul because you\'re not moving.\' But that\'s aggravating to a guy.\"\nBoroski: \"100 percent. Nah, you\'re right. I should have taken a foul on it. It\'s a foul.\"\nIn ref lingo, \"take\" a foul means \"call\" a foul.\nSteratore and Scirotto are off to Chicago. They\'ll work with veteran official Mike Eades for the next night\'s Maryland-Northwestern game.\nBoroski is off to New Jersey to work the Creighton-Seton Hall game. En route to his hotel, he says he\'ll lock in Channel 22 on SiriusXM — Pearl Jam Radio.\nBig Ten command center, Rosemont, Feb. 15\nThe No. 1 complaint from Big Ten coaches about refs? They work too many games.\n\"They have to be tired,\" one said. \"They work six days a week in six different cities, travel every day, run the floor with elite athletes.\"\n\"When do they recover?\" another asked.\nIt\'s a valid concern.\nAs Steratore puts it: \"We are young cars with lot of miles.\"\nAnd many of them have day jobs and families. Steratore has a family business (brother Tony, also an NFL official, co-owns it) that sells janitorial supplies in Pittsburgh. As an NFL referee, he explained to America that Calvin Johnson did not \"complete\" that 2010 end-zone catch at Soldier Field. He also put three kids through college, debt-free.\n\"I single-parented for the last 17 years, ran a business and did both sports,\" he says. \"My children used to get on an air mattress and lie in the back of a (Dodge) Durango and I\'d go to New York City, ref a game and they\'d sleep on the air mattress. And I\'d carry them in at 5 in the morning (back in Pittsburgh), put them in the shower and get them to school. The sacrifices are immense.\"\nBut here\'s why guys like Steratore, who walks tilted to one side because of a strained back, work so many games: They\'re needed.\n\"Why are there only 70 guys working 100 games?\" Steratore says. \"You think it\'s because we\'re greedy? There\'s a difference between being a play-calling official and a referee who can manage the game.\"\nOfficials are independent contractors making between $1,200 and $3,000 per night depending on the competition level and their experience. They do often work four to five games a week, but Boyages has helped the profession immensely by leading the Collegiate Officiating Consortium, which assigns more than 130 officials to the Big Ten, Mid-American, Metro Atlantic, Summit and Northern Sun (Division II) conferences.\nThe streamlined scheduling allows Steratore — who would rather not fly — to work, say, one night in Ann Arbor, Mich., and the next in Ypsilanti. And because officials cannot expense transportation costs, they might be more prone to take a $2,000 MAC assignment than a $2,800 job on the East Coast.\n\"Constantly getting up at 4:30 for a 6 a.m. flight after a 9 o\'clock game, maybe you can do that in your 30s and 40s,\" says Steratore, 54.\nBoyages\' top officials work no more than 35 to 38 Big Ten games each season. Rarely, if ever, will an official see the same team twice in a seven-day span.\n\"Familiarity is a dangerous thing,\" Steratore says. \"Even if you are my brother, we\'ll have to go to a different bathroom to shave every once in a while.\"\nThe West Lafayette/Evanston back-to-back makes for easy travel for Steratore and Scirotto, who meet Boyages at the Big Ten command center to review plays and grab lunch. Upon returning to Chicago the previous night at 11, Boyages talked them into late-night burgers at Au Cheval.\n\"We can\'t hang out with Rick,\" Scirotto says. \"I\'d have to go to the gym three times a day.\"\nLunch, Park Tavern, Rosemont, Feb. 15\nEx-coaches love telling stories. Here\'s one: Before shifting to administration, Boyages toiled as a coach at William & Mary, which has never made the NCAA tournament. He got so enraged at the officiating during a 2001 game at East Carolina, he pointed to different spots on the floor and shouted: \"Foul! Foul! Foul!\"\nMike Eades responded by giving Boyages the heave-ho.\nNow Boyages determines which Big Ten games Eades will work. One is on this night in Evanston with Steratore and Scirotto.\n\"Glad Rick had a change of heart about me,\" Eades said, grinning.\nEades, primarily an ACC ref, is a fixture at North Carolina -Duke battles and has worked two of the last four Final Fours.\nAll that is nice, Eades said, but \"if they\'re keeping score, it\'s a big game.\"\nEades, 51, lives in West Virginia, where he works with at-risk youth. In his younger days, according to Boyages, Eades wore tight shirts to show off his physique and moussed his hair.\n\"Confirmed,\" Eades responds.\nLast month at the Iowa-Michigan State game, Eades\' whistle broke off its lanyard. He searched his pockets for a backup as if hunting for car keys. After coming up dry, he had to jog back to the officials\' locker room.\n\"Mike,\" Iowa assistant coach Kirk Speraw kidded him, \"you refereed a whole lot better when you did not have the whistle.\"\nTipoff, Welsh-Ryan Arena, Evanston, Feb. 15\n\"It\'s going to be a hot one tonight,\" Steratore tells Scirotto and Eades before popping in a stick of Juicy Fruit and heading to the floor.\nHe means that literally and figuratively. Welsh-Ryan Arena is four games from being gutted. With the crowd near capacity, it can get steamy.\n\"The sidelines are tight,\" Steratore says.\nSo are the coaches. This is a huge game for Northwestern\'s Chris Collins and Maryland\'s Mark Turgeon. Steratore says he expects them to be \"wound up.\"\nNorthwestern plays a crummy first half, in part because do-everything point guard Bryant McIntosh exits after getting whistled for two fouls in the first three minutes — bumping Anthony Cowan on a drive and colliding with a rebounder.\nWith 4:28 to play in the half, Steratore rings him up again, ruling that McIntosh drove his right shoulder into a defender before shooting a short jumper. Collins barks a bit. Northwestern trails 32-22 at the break.\nWith 4:28 to play in the half, Steratore rings him up again\nGene Steratore calls Bryant McIntosh for his third personal foul.

(Courtesy of the Big Ten Conference)\nSee more videos\nHalftime, Feb. 15\nWhile the crowd is transfixed by the bowl-tossing acrobatics of Red Panda, Boyages lingers at the scoring table to use the DVSport system to check out replays of about a dozen calls and non-calls. He wants to be prepared for his postgame session.\nBoyages checks to see whether NU forward Gavin Skelly got held going after a loose ball. Not really, he decides. A valid non-call. He also scrutinizes a play that occurred three minutes into the game — Wildcats center Dererk Pardon bodying up Damonte Dodd on a missed shot in the paint.\nBoyages checks to see whether NU forward Gavin Skelly got held going after a loose ball\nDererk Pardon gets away with a foul in the paint.

(Courtesy of the Big Ten Conference)\nSee more videos\nBoyages studies McIntosh\'s third foul, saying: \"It\'s a judgment call. Gene is in great position.\"\nSecond half, Feb. 15\nMelo Trimble looks like a lottery pick. In the midst of a 32-point game, the Maryland point guard surges past Pardon for a layup and briefly glares at Scirotto. Trimble, whom Steratore has praised for being fair and easy to converse with, wanted an \"and one\" call.\nNext time down, Scirotto tells Trimble: \"I know you don\'t complain. I\'ll watch it better.\"\nThey low-five.\nA frustrated Vic Law commits an obvious over-the-back foul and complains a bit to Scirotto, who tells the NU forward: \"Vic, that\'s a foul, bud.\"\nAs Scirotto puts it later: \"It\'s never, \'Shut up, kid, and play basketball.\' We interact without being defensive.\"\nSteratore tells young officials to be unafraid to engage players and coaches. Don\'t do it \"when the fire is too hot,\" he tells them. \"Wait till the water is good.\"\nMaryland leads by 12 with about five minutes to play, but Turgeon is barking at Steratore. He wanted a timeout called once the Terrapins crossed halfcourt, but coaches can\'t call for time during live-ball situations. Trimble twice called for time with the ball in the backcourt.\n\"Mark said, \'What the hell are you doing?\'\" Steratore says. \"Whoa. He says, \'You know what I wanted.\' I tell him, \'Well, I\'m not playing for you.\'\"\nPostgame, Feb. 15\nA shower runs near the officials\' cramped locker room at Welsh-Ryan. But before getting clean, the refs will spend nearly 30 minutes reviewing plays with Boyages, who praises their work.\n\"You guys did a really good job — great job on offense-initiated contact all night long,\" he says. \"Any time a guard jumped in (to a defender), you were consistent laying off (the call).\"\nBoyages had warned the officials before the game about a Maryland freshman who has tricked refs by locking arms with a defender and making it appear he was getting obstructed.\n\"A lot of us work multiple conferences,\" Steratore says. \"Nobody else in college basketball preps us like this. Nobody.\"\nBut with about two minutes to play, Steratore whistled NU guard Isiah Brown for a foul on an inbound play. Brown couldn\'t believe it, motioning that Cowan, the freshman guard, had hooked him.\n\"Heads-up play by Cowan to draw that foul,\" analyst Stephen Bardo said on the BTN telecast.\nIndeed it was. Chatting with his fellow officials, Steratore says he was duped.\nHere\'s what he told Cowan on the floor: \"You got me. Don\'t be defensive. Don\'t act like you\'re innocent. You got me. ... But you could have missed the dang front end (of the one-and-one free throw) so I wouldn\'t feel so bad.\"\nSteratore smiles. He wasn\'t perfect.\nYou know what that means? He\'s not about to quit.\n')[0m

Time Inc. is following in the steps of Tastemade and BuzzFeed\'s Tasty among others by diving into social food videos.\nLaunching March 2, Well Done is being produced by a 10-person video team out of Time Inc.’s test kitchens in Birmingham, Alabama. They’ll produce six to eight short vertical videos a day for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and Pinterest. It’s overseen by Stacey Rivera, digital content director for Cooking Light and My Recipes and head of Time Inc.’s newly created digital food desk.\nWell Done is the latest example of Time Inc.’s newfound effort to coordinate efforts across its titles. It recently created the digital desks to pool its editorial resources, and launched Coinage , a series of personal finance videos that will live across its brands. Similarly, Well Done will draw recipe content from the company’s nine food brands including My Recipes, Cooking Light to Southern Living, which will promote Well Done using their social feeds. The company is also planning to launch a similar product around health.\nFacebook has given preference to video in its feed, and lifestyle publishers have been happy to comply. Food video views on Facebook last year were up 283 percent over 2015, according to Tubular Labs. Fast-paced social food videos shot from above have become so ubiquitous , they’ve given rise to ever-smaller niches (witness Business Insider and its Facebook pages devoted to cheese and desserts ), parodies and a variety of formats. Cooking Panda, for instance, has added cartoons and a travel show to its repertoire, while food publisher Twisted has made bizarre food combinations its stock in trade.\nAnd yet, Time Inc. still believes there’s still room for more, given what it says is viewer demand for dinner recipes, hacks and explainers of food trends like Instant Pot and coconut.\n\'You will not just get hands in bowls,\' Rivera said of the ubiquitous overhead-shot recipe formula. \'People love hands in bowls. I’m not hating on that. It’s definitely a piece. But there’s more. And what’s going to be different is what’s in the bowls. That’s what’s going to make it exciting.\'\nDigiday Publishing Awards Europe\nEarly deadline\n')[0m

We just wanted to call attention to the fact that if one looks not just at nominal interest rates, but at all costs involved [in FX issues] as well as exchange rate risks, forint financing is more advantageous at present than FX financing,\" Mr Palotai told the paper.\n\n\n\"The NBH does not want to have a say in debt management, rather it wants to support a reduction in the country\'s vulnerability,\" he added, noting steps the central bank has taken to boost demand for forint government securities.\n\n\n\"We can finance ourselves from internal sources and in forints. That\'s why we believe that a strategy built on the foundation of forint financing continues to be achievable, and more advantageous,\" he said, adding that the NBH also sees further opportunity to move in the direction of securities with longer maturities.\n\n\nMr Palotai said that the issue of a low-volume onshore \"panda\" yuan-bond would be \"favourable\" as it could \"support geographical diversification\" and \"serve economic diplomacy goals\".\n\n\nNational Economy Minister Mihaly Varga said late last year that the government plans FX issues of EUR 1.2bn in 2017, but the volume could vary depending on market possibilities. Hungary could tap euro, USD, yuan or yen bond markets, he added.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n        \nBack to the list\n\n\n')[0m

Longtime CHLA supporter Kim       Kardashian West joined the hospital to kick off the campaign, which has       attracted the commitment of more than 100 businesses in Los Angeles and       the Coachella Valley. The month-long community fundraising drive is       helping local businesses rally community participation to raise  1       million in the month of March to support children’s health in Los       Angeles and surrounding communities.\nThis Smart News Release features multimedia.

The campaign aims to raise  1 million in March. (Pierson is the campaign\'s poster girl). (Photo by Keats Elliott)\n\'Make March Matter is a movement uniting companies and individuals to       bring awareness to the healthcare needs of children and to maintain the       programs and services at CHLA that address those needs,\' says Children’s       Hospital Los Angeles president and CEO Paul Viviano. \'We are fortunate       to have such a compassionate and loyal group of partners helping us to       fulfill our mission of creating hope and building healthier futures for       our patients and their families.\'\nEach year, CHLA treats children who face a broad range of health issues,       from common illnesses to traumas to chronic diseases. The hospital is       also dedicated to innovation, supporting advances in research designed       to improve pediatric health outcomes and partnering with physicians       across the nation to bring the best care here to children in Los Angeles.\nThe hospital relies on the generosity of the community to support its       groundbreaking pediatric research and the complex care it provides for       critically ill and injured children. Last year, 67 local business and       corporate partners helped the inaugural campaign exceed its  1 million       goal, raising a total of  1.3 million to aid in funding life-saving care       for children in Los Angeles.\nHere’s how the community and individuals can help Make March Matter:\nSupport the businesses that support CHLA. For a complete list of the         more than 100 participating partners and local events taking place         throughout the month of March, go to MakeMarchMatter.org.\nMake a donation at MakeMarchMatter.org.\nIndividuals may share how they are participating in the campaign on         social platforms using #MakeMarchMatter\nCorporate Partners\nCorporations across the southland have agreed to support community       members in giving back. Each business has selected a unique way to       contribute to the campaign’s collective impact—some sell specific items       with proceeds supporting CHLA patients, others devote a portion of       overall sales for the entire month and still others create their own       unique fundraising campaigns to galvanize their employees and consumers       to contribute.\n\"Panda Restaurant Group is honored to be part of Children\'s Hospital Los       Angeles\' Make March Matter campaign again this year,\" says Calvin Lee,       vice president of Operations. \"Giving is one of Panda\'s core values and       it inspired our associates\' passion to raise  350,000 to help children       in need last year. We are committed to be the campaign\'s top fundraiser       again in 2017.\"\nBy visiting, shopping and dining with a business supporting       #MakeMarchMatter, individuals can activate donations to support the care       of patients at CHLA.

Rath has been in fine form for them of late, registering his maiden List A century against Netherlands a couple of weeks ago and following it with an innings of 88 in the next game. He also registered his highest first-class score of 98 not out - with another 88 in the second innings - in the Intercontinental Cup against Netherlands.

Rivals Dunkin\' Donuts, Chipotle, Starbucks and Taco Bell already allow customers to place orders digitally. ', 'March 01, 2017\nBy Peter Frost\nMcDonald\'s launching mobile ordering this year\nIn an effort to stem a flow of customers away from its restaurants, McDonald\'s today said it is launching mobile ordering, mobile pay and curbside pickup across its 14,000-plus U.S. restaurants in the fourth quarter, executives said this morning.\nThe burger chain, which said it lost some 500 million sales transactions since 2012—most to \"near-in competitors\"—said its biggest priority was improving foot traffic to its restaurants. In a special meeting with investors and analysts held today in a West Loop warehouse, CEO Steve Easterbrook said the Oak Brook-based fast-food giant is hoping its new digital efforts—along with overhauling its restaurants, improving the quality of its food and introducing new burger and chicken options—will help get lure more customers to its stores.\nMcDonald\'s is playing catch-up when it comes to mobile ordering. Competitors Dunkin\' Donuts, Chipotle, Starbucks and Taco Bell already allow customers to place orders digitally.\nRelated: McD\'s doubles down on \'restaurants of the future\' \n\"Our most important priority is guest counts,\" Chief Strategy Officer Lucy Brady said at the event.\nThe company also plans a bigger push into delivery, almost certainly with a third-party provider, which executives said requires no capital investment from McDonald\'s or its franchisees. It started testing delivery in January with UberEats in Florida and said it would expand into more markets this year, noting that some 75 percent of its customers in its largest markets live within 3 miles of its restaurants. Brady said the chain intends to expand and deploy delivery \"rapidly.\"\n\"We\'re focusing on changes that have the biggest benefit to the most customers in the shortest period of time,\" Brady said. During its pilot in Florida, McDonald\'s said it found that much of the demand for delivery came during off-peak hours, which translates to an \"incremental and profitable\" opportunity.\nIn addition to its test with UberEats, McDonald\'s has worked with other third-party mobile app operators, such as Postmates and Foodpanda, to test delivery. In its presentation to investors, the chain also named other delivery services, such as Chicago-based GrubHub. Easterbrook said McDonald\'s is talking with several third-party delivery companies in several countries with the intent to partner with one or more of them on plans to roll out delivery in multiple \"major\" countries, including the U.S., this year.\n\"We\'re not testing, we\'re rolling it out,\" he said. \"We\'re bringing major international countries online this year and expanding in the U.S.\"\nIn its presentation to investors earlier in the day, the chain named multiple delivery services, such as Chicago-based GrubHub. Though McDonald\'s didn\'t announce a partnership with the delivery company, GrubHub\'s stock surged as much as 3.4 percent, its biggest intraday gain in more than a month. Grubhub —which delivers for chains such as Subway, Panda Express, PF Chang, Fatburger, California Pizza Kitchen and Little Caesars — says it has been talking with McDonald\'s about a potential delivery partnership.\nThough McDonald\'s didn\'t announce a partnership with the delivery company, GrubHub\'s stock surged as much as 3.4 percent, its biggest intraday gain in more than a month. Grubhub —which delivers for chains such as Subway, Panda Express, PF Chang, Fatburger, California Pizza Kitchen and Little Caesars — says it has been talking with McDonald\'s about a potential delivery partnership.\nAlso today, McDonald\'s said that by year-end, 2,500 restaurants will be transformed into its \"Experience of the Future\" format, with table service, self-serve ordering kiosks and an expanded McCafe menu. The company expects to have almost all its U.S. stores converted by the end of 2020.\nMcDonald\'s in the U.S., France and Canada that have converted to the to the new format have posted sales bumps of between 4 percent and 8 percent, the company said. In addition to offering new conveniences to diners, the company is hoping to lure back once-loyal customers with improvements to its food and a renewed focus on its McCafe coffee offerings. \"Some of our best customers just aren\'t visiting as much as they used to and we know why,\'\' Brady said. \"Our historical advantages of quality, convenience and value didn\'t keep pace.\"\nFor 2019 and beyond, McDonald\'s said it expects to expand its operating margin from the high-20 percent range to the mid-40 percent range, as it sells more of its restaurants to franchisees and relies more heavily on royalty fees.\nBy the end of this year, the company expects 93 percent of its restaurants to be franchised. That would be a year ahead of schedule.\nMcDonald\'s shares gained 1.1 percent to end the day at $129.05.\nRead more:\nMcDonald\'s new Chicago HQ just got bigger \n\nBloomberg and Associated Press contributed.\n\n...\nTo see the full article, subscribe or log in.\n')[0m

He appears to have thicker skin and be less prone to distraction than the average Red Sox, new or old.\nPlus - and this is the tipping point - he\'s already at home.\nHis switch from Chicago\'s Arizona Cactus League base to the Red Sox\' home in Fort Myers means he is only a half hour from his Naples residence.\nHe\'s a couple of miles from his college home, Florida Gulf Coast University.\nHis second son was born in December and No. 1 son, Rylan, is a 6-year-old who is having his first soccer practice this afternoon.\nSale will be at the practice.\nDon\'t underestimate the value Sale provides to his growing family and the joy and peace of mind he gains being around the house for these seven weeks of training.\nThat has to go a long, long way toward making Sale feel more comfortable more quickly any other new Red Sox in recent history.\nHe\'ll tell you the same thing.\n\"It\'s worked out very well, not only for myself but for my family,\" Sale said. \"Just being able to drive 30 minutes up the road every day for work, it doesn\'t get much better than that. Being able to go home and sleep in my own bed and hang out with my kids a little more, it\'s awesome. I\'m appreciative of it for sure.\"\nSale barely has to look over his shoulder before bumping into a familiar face.\nTim Roberson, a minor league catcher in the Red Sox system, caught Sale at Florida Gulf Coast.\nAnd he\'s not the only old FGC teammate.\n\"It\'s awesome (and) that\'s kind of what goes into making this a more seamless of a transition is how many ties I have to southwest Florida and how many people are here from FGC,\" Sale said. \"There are a couple of guys in the weight room that are interns here, Edgar Barreto, the strength and conditioning coordinator for the minor leagues, I played with him my freshman year on the baseball team. All those factors going in help me get adjusted a little bit better here.\"\nAnother reason: Sale\'s a native of Florida. He grew up in Lakeland, about 150 miles to the north.\nHis presence in the White Sox\' training complex in Phoenix the last six years were his only springs away from the Sunshine State.\n\"I grew up in this - I prefer it to be 100 degrees every day than 50 (degrees),\" Sale said.\nIt\'s true that there\'s a lot more time to be spent on buses for road games in the Grapefruit League than the Cactus League, but don\'t even try to imagine this is going to sour Sale.\nThe fact that he has to be part of a 21⁄2 hour bus drive for his first spring training start of the season on Sunday in West Palm Beach is nothing but a positive for Sale.\n\"It\'s perfect,\" said Sale. \"My in-laws live over there, so we\'ll turn it into a nice overnight stay, eat some good food, play some ping pong and have a good time.\"\nSale\'s yet to throw meaningful pitches in a Red Sox uniform.\nWhen he does throw them, he\'ll already have the look and feel of a natural.\nJoin the Conversation\n')[0m

In the letters, Amb. Cui expressed appreciation for the students\' enthusiasm on protecting wildlife and told them about what China has done in this field over the past years. He wrote: in China, it is public consensus that wildlife should be protected and illegal trade should be banned. In fact, China has been doing a lot more than just protecting the elephants. If you have a chance to visit China, you will find a lot of endangered animals well protected in their natural habitat: giant panda (as you all know), snub-nosed monkey, Tibetan antelope, red-crowned crane, Manchurian tiger, just to name a few.

Living up to the company\'s motto of \"good games have no borders\", lead developers of NetEase\'s five flagship games shared development concepts and behind-the-scene stories with an audience of gamers, industry peers, and reporters.

No roads have been replaced in his two years. There\'s not enough money for salt and sand.\nThe Department of Public Works has been cut so much that its director had to warn the mayor about the department\'s inability to do its job.\nOur Public Works director said that for every one dollar we don\'t spend maintaining our roads now, it will cost us five dollars in the future.\nWhere is the road committee he said he would form?\nHe cut funding for the replacement of one of two ambulances without asking what the needs were.\nHis pattern of unlawful behavior, arrogance, dictatorship and disingenuousness has been repeated over and over.\nHe writes half-truths on social media.\n\"No asbestos found at JPS\" turns into 12 locations of asbestos when the report is finally made public.\nHe kicked the New Milford Children\'s Center off the town\'s insurance pool after being considered a town agency for 45 years.\nHe does not understand that the Children\'s Center pays for itself and drives local economic and social stimulus.\nOur mayor didn\'t understand the inner workings of our wastewater treatment plant. He directed it to triple sewer rates. He said he would not forgive a \"sewer debt\" he did not understand and then forgave the debt all the while telling the public he did not?\nWe then learn this past week that the taxpayers now pay $98,000 to the Sewer Commission every year and that is how he \"forgave\" the debt.\nHe didn\'t bother to sit down with the Board of Ed and had no idea what he was cutting. Then to the dismay of the BOE, he said at its budget hearing that he did not. He threw his own friends on the BOE under the bus when they turned down an offer he reneged on.\nHe proposed the Panda natural gas-fired power plant, then walked away when the flames got too hot and the public rallied against it.\nHe proposed a solar farm on open-space farmland and again backed away when he could not get support.\nJust one more example where he did not seek the public\'s opinion and wishes before he decided to support it 100 percent.\nHe harassed and upset the arts commission, the Chamber of Commerce , local business organizations and continues to threatened his own employees.\nYour husband, our mayor, constantly ignores the Town Charter , State Statutes, state and federal regulations and then uses the less-experienced Democratic town attorney, not town attorney Randy DiBella , who has decades of experience, to write opinions that appear to protect his illegal actions.\nOur mayor, is being sued in Superior Court for misappropriating taxpayer\'s funds and thinks that the Waste Management money is his to fool with as he pleases.\nNow he withdrew his zoning application for JPS because he figures he can ignore our zoning regulations and spend our money without our permission to fulfill his misguided campaign promise to a handful of people that he would \"save JPS.\"\nHe promised to cut 12 years of fat including high-paid school administrators at the mayoral debate, yet he hires more employees (at a cost of over $902,364) and is trying to grow our government\'s footprint that will cost us dearly.\nYour husband, our mayor, failed to provide revenue sources at the budget hearing to the Town Council and the Board of Finance , once again ignoring the Charter and State Statutes.\nHow can they do their jobs without them? Yes Vanessa, where is the revenue growth from economic development?\nVanessa, I hope our mayor stops \"persisting\" and instead engages the public to get their buy-in before he makes decisions that cost taxpayers millions of dollars in their hard-earned money!\nGreg Mullen\nNew Milford\n')[0m

The two worlds that characterise the brand, the functional and the emotional, are evoked by the symbolism of the stand and, in a practical sense, by the vehicles exhibited.\nIn 2017, FCA will be celebrating the sixtieth birthday of the iconic 500: the star of the show will be the special limited edition to mark the 60th anniversary, which will feature an exclusive look and unique contents including new two-colour paintwork and specific 16 alloy wheels. It will be joined by 500S, the more dynamic, male version of this Fiat icon. The Swiss event will also witness the début of the new S-Design versions, a perfect combination of style and contents designed to meet the requirements of a dynamic, sporty clientele: this new image will be flaunted by the Fiat Tipo 5Doors and the 500X on the stand. Not to mention an appearance by the whole Tipo family: representing personality, simplicity and functionality with unbeatable value for money.\nExclusive details, uncompromising off-road performance and outstanding versatility: on board the new Fiat Fullback Cross pick-up, there is room for meeting everyone’s requirements, whatever they may be. The spotlight will then fall on an exciting vehicle that treats the motorist to a true roadster experience, combined with an all-Italian style: the 124 Spider, with the new \'Europa\' special series, built in a numbered limited edition. Personality and style are also at the top of the list for the Panda, Italy\'s best-selling car in its segment since 2012. The stand will host the Cross version, which crams all the functional features of the off-road vehicles in the category above it into just 370 centimetres of space, as well as the Natural Power, which reduces emissions while still guaranteeing a pleasant, comfortable driving experience. 500L is on show in the Trekking version in a two-colour livery underlining the model\'s crossover personality, reinforced by the Traction+ technology.\nAnd last but not least, the stand will feature areas dedicated to Mopar and FCA Bank, both providing true added value for all motorists in the form of excellent products and services.\nFiat 500 special series to mark the 60th anniversary\nThere are dates which are destined to remain firmly lodged in our collective memory; moments which, in the short-term, or with the passing of time, can prove to be revolutionary. One of the dates which has undoubtedly managed to escape the anonymity often imposed by the calendar is the 4th of July, 1957. Indeed, this was the momentous date on which the \'500\' was first produced in Turin, the \'big small car\' which soon became the emblem of the concept of driving for the mass market. The figures linked to this success may be significant, but they are simply not enough to tell the whole story. Over 4 million vehicles have been sold, but there’s more to understanding this car than that. Instead, the trick is to widen our perspective and pay particular attention in order to round up all the innovative features that the 500 has crammed into a space of less than three metres, not only with regard to the motoring world but in relation to society in general. Fifty years on, again on the 4th of July, Fiat used its popularity as leverage for accelerating towards the future with the 500 of the new millennium and in the first months of 2017 will break the record of two million cars sold. Another peaceful revolution on the roads of the world, a vehicle capable of combining what seem to be contrasting values: it is exclusive but accessible, it is elegant but fun, it is quinquennially Italian but is a global best-seller sold in 100 countries. Interestingly 80% of all 500s were sold outside Italy.\nWhen Fiat celebrates sixty years of its global icon, for the occasion, the Geneva show will provide the stage for the launch of the special 60th anniversary series. This exclusive numbered limited edition pays tribute to the original 500 through a specific characterisation and the contemporary reinterpretation of some of the style details that made it famous, such as the vinyl dashboard, the vintage logo on the front, between the chrome spoiler and on the boot door and steering wheel, as well as the chrome finish on the bonnet. Exclusively available as a convertible, the Fiat 500 special 60th anniversary series presents brand new dual-colour paintwork evocatively named Dolcevita: Three-layer White for the body of the car and pastel Ivory for the bonnet and pillars. The grey and burgundy waistrail enhances this chromatic combination, whereas the colour chosen for the hood is grey. The style of this special series is enhanced by its many cool aesthetic details, such as chrome mirror caps, special 16\' lightweight alloy wheel rims and a dedicated logo: 560. Here we truly have a brand within a brand, as the red \'6\' and \'0\' are contained in the last two figures of the 500 logo. This exclusive badge adorns the pillar and also appears on the chrome sill and the numbered limited edition nameplate. The Fiat 500 60th anniversary special series will be available for order from 9 March; the edition will total 560 cars, all with individual authenticity certificate, for sale on the main EMEA region markets with delivery from 4 July. The interior also presents retro details, such as the tubular elements of the seats in ivory leather with contrasting burgundy seams, which match the central part of the dashboard, and the bespoke dual-colour car mats. But the tribute to the past is only skin deep: in terms of technology, the 60th anniversary special series offers the very best of everything available today when it comes to technology and on-board comfort. Standard features include a leather gear stick knob and steering wheel with built-in commands, the 7\' Uconnect™ Radio Live touchscreen system with Bluetooth, satellite navigator and USB and AUX IN ports; 7\' TFT, automatic climate control, fog lights and rear parking sensors. The MY2017 innovations are also present: Speed Limiter and Cruise control and, on request, the CarPlay and Android AutoTM system; this makes possible for users to access the main applications of their smartphones directly on the 7 screen of the UconnectTM system integrated on the central console.\nWith Apple CarPlay support, the smarter, safer way to use your iPhone in the car, drivers can get directions optimized for traffic conditions, make and receive calls, access text messages, and listen to music, all in a way that allows them to stay focused on the road.\nThe Android Auto integration allow to manage the compatible content and features on the device directly from the driving seat, getting directions, making calls, sending and receiving messages, and listening to music, always driving safely.\nRain & Dusk sensor, Bi-Xenon headlights, tinted rear windows and Beats AudioTM system repeat this impressive outfit. The selection of engines available on the 500 Sessantesimo is wide-ranging and complete, with two petrol engines – also available with robotic Dualogic gearbox and paddle shift – the 1.2 with 69 HP and the 0.9 TwinAir with 85 HP. In the combined cycle, this results in a consumption rate of 3.8 litres/100km. All engines are Euro 6, including the small turbodiesel 1.3 16v Multijet II 95 HP version. The vehicle on the stand will be a 1.2 69 HP, fitted with Stop & Start.\nS-Design\nThe S-Design is the Fiat answer to those who seek style and content with a contemporary, dynamic and distinctive character.This version combines sportiness, style and seduction that captivate at first glance: a striking personality reflecting the young male target and well tailored to both the brand\'s worlds, both functional and emotional. Geneva will see the debut of the 500X S-Design and the Tipo 5-door S-Design, for those who wish their car to strongly express their own dynamic style.\nFiat 500X S-Design\nIntroducing the Fiat 500X S-Design, the new special series which combines a new concept of urban sporting feel and attention to detail in its two identities: City Look and Off-Road. Available for order from June, the car on the stand, an S-Design City Look in the new matt Alpi Green colour, is fitted with the high-performance 140 HP (103kW) 1.4 Multijet engine and has an automatic DCT dual clutch transmission. Its exclusive matte livery sports details in polished steel such as the side mouldings, door handles, front spoiler, the rim of the rear headlights, the handle of the boot and the mirror caps. It also features tinted rear windows. The car on display has 18 wheels and a distinctive two-colour finish. To complete the effect, the Xenon headlights, also burnished, give the 500X an immediately recognisable, dynamic, distinctive \"face\". These dark details are also replicated in the style of the interior, for example in the dashboard panel and in the mouldings of the central tunnel and door panels. Again in the interior, the specific S-Design seats feature a sporty fabric with embroidered, copper coloured logo.\nWith S-Design, the unmistakeable elegance of 500X is enhanced with a touch of modern style and a sporty identity.\nFiat Tipo 5Doors S-Design\nOn the stand, visitors will be able to admire the new S-Design Tipo 5Doors that brings the family additional dynamic style and personality in the bespoke \'Metropoli Grey\' livery, exclusively designed for this version. The car is immediately recognisable thanks to its distinctive wide grille with Piano Black trims, which embraces the whole of the front and ends with an even more aggressive feature in the Bi-Xenon front headlights with the same trims. Making their first appearance in the Tipo family, the Bi-Xenon units enhance performance by 30% compared to the standard version. The Piano Black details continue around the edges of the sporty air inlets and on the rear view mirror caps. The new diamond pattern 18 alloy wheels give another very dynamic touch to the car\'s image, while the version is completed by tinted rear windows and features such as the handles coloured to match the bodywork.\nThe interior is completely restyled, with leather and fabric seats and tactile finishes chosen for their strong, distinctive personality.\nThe double stitching of the seats in leather and Airtex match those on the gear stick knob and steering wheel in \'technoleather\' with a criss-cross pattern. The dashboard features details in \'Piano Black\' and has a large fascia in Technical Grey which spans the whole width of the cabin.\nOther unique details appear on the central unit and upholstered door panels. Under the bonnet of the car on show is the 1.4 T-jet engine that develops 120 HP (88 kW) of maximum power achieved at 5.000 rpm and has a maximum torque of 215 Nm at 2.500 rpm. This guarantees high gear flexibility and a rapid, bold response. The S-Design version, also available in Cinema Black, Amore Red, Gelato White and Colosseo Grey colours and with 120 HP 1.6 Multijet Diesel engine with manual gearbox or automatic transmission with DCT dual clutch, 110 HP 1.6 E-Torq petrol engine with automatic transmission and a 120 HP LPG-Petrol 1.4 T-jet unit, is a characterful, stylish addition to the Tipo family, and will shortly also be offered on the Tipo Station Wagon.\nFiat Fullback Cross\nFiat Fullback is the pick-up truck dedicated to motorists who want a functional vehicle that still sets them free in their leisure time, by combining practicality with a vocation for the wild outdoors.\nFullback has a bold character reflected in its sporty proportions and at the Geneva Motor Show it is set to be the star of the show with the world premiere of the Cross version. The new pick-up in Cross trim is available in the double cabin version, with a length of 5.28 metres and a breadth of 3 metres. The width measures 1.81 metres and the height is 1.78 metres. The model on show will sport the Colosseum Grey livery.\nFullback Cross features exclusive stylistic details, such as the grille with matt black ingots. The front is completed by the satin silver skid plate. There are more eye-catching black details on the sides, such as the rear view mirrors, the handles and the wheel arches, the 17 wheels and the new-design larger side steps. Last but not least, the exclusive textured black sport bar gives the Fullback Cross a sleeker silhouette and underlines its dynamic profile. The Fullback Cross\'s individual look is completed by the new all-black cargo space, with the Fiat logo in relief. The effect is to emphasise its personality as an exceptionally versatile lifestyle vehicle, equally ideal for work and leisure.\nIt is fitted with a 2.4 litre common rail turbodiesel engine and develops 180 HP (133 kW) of power and a torque of 430 Nm. Its top speed is 179 km/h (111 mph). There are also two transmissions available: six-speed manual or five-speed automatic with sporty sequential mode and dashboard commands. The 5-gear automatic version is the one that has been chosen for the Geneva Motor Show. The full traction option is the strength of this model, with a Torsen centre differential which can be locked using the lower gears and an E-locker rear differential locker for more extreme terrains.\nThe Cross features a particularly varied range of accessories, from all points of view. For safety, standard accessories include ABS with EBD, TSA (Trailer Stability Assist – a system which boosts stability during towing), LDW (Lane Departure Warning), seven airbags, Cruise Control. Not forgetting Bi-Xenon headlights, front fog lights and LED daytime running lights (DRL). The interiors feature leather seats, steering wheel and gear stick knob, automatic dual zone climate control and automatic full traction selector. The infotainment equipment includes a DAB CD/MP3 Radio with 7\' touchscreen, Bluetooth and USB port. The front seats are also heated, with six-way electric adjustment on the driver\'s side. The system includes a rear parking camera and satellite navigator. Mopar has developed customised accessories for the Fullback Cross: the easy-open turn and tilt door and the bed step for easier access to the large cargo section. The set-up is completed with the chrome-plated kick plate and rubber floor mats.\nFullback Cross is displayed next to the Panda Cross, and extends and completes the Cross range of models with a peerless mix of exclusive styling and extreme versatility. Models designed and developed for any kind of adventure, from the urban jungle to exploration of the natural world.\nFiat 124 Spider Europa\nThe new Fiat 124 Spider is an exciting 2-seater, the only Fiat 2-seater, capable of winning over the new generations. This already occurred back in 1966, with its legendary predecessor, which rode the characteristic wave of euphoria which swept through the 1960s with the wind in its hair. Today, its style embodies the timeless beauty of its predecessor while remaining true to its real self and it guarantees high levels of performance, technology and safety.\nAt the Geneva Motor Show, visitors will be able to admire the new special limited edition series, 124 Spider Europa, which celebrates the launch of the original version by Pininfarina at the same event 36 years ago, with a new, special set of features. The model on display will flaunt its best features in Passione Red bodywork, the ultimate colour that identifies Italian sporty \'2-seaters\' and a set of 17\' four-spoke alloy wheels, developed by Mopar as a tribute to the original version. An additional touch of style is added by the silver rear view mirror caps and black leather seats. The vehicle contains a wide range of equipment: 4 airbags, full-led front headlamps with Adaptive Front Light System, which direct the beam of light based on the speed and the direction of the curve, 7\' radio, mp3 with USB port and premium Bose Hi-Fi system with 9 speakers, including a dual speaker set in the headrest of both seats and a subwoofer, leather steering wheel. Cruise control, keyless entry, rear camera and navigation system with 3D maps.\nFinally, the 124 Spider Europa has a celebratory, numbered plaque inside and the 124 logo on the front grille. From a technical viewpoint, the vehicle on display at the Motor Show is fitted with manual 6-gear transmission, combined with a 4-cylinder turbo 1.4 litre engine featuring MultiAir technology, which provides 140 HP of power and 240 Nm of torque for impressive performances: 215 km/h (133 mph) maximum speed, and only 7.5 seconds for accelerating from 0 to 100 km/h. The 124 Spider system features a high double wishbone suspension on the front and a multi-link on the rear. Steering is precise and responsive with the use of an electric power assist system. In short, the combination of the steering and suspension set-ups lightweight frame, balanced weight distribution and turbocharged engine ensures a dynamic driving experience.\nNatural Power\nThe stand in Geneva will be reserving a space dedicated to sustainable mobility, which will host a Panda Natural Power. The Panda celebrates the milestone of the 300,000th natural gas car built since 2006, and is in Lounge version with a livery specially created for the event. It has the 80 HP TwinAir Turbo Natural Power engine. This bi-fuel two-cylinder version develops 80 HP (59 kW) and consumes 4.5 litres of petrol or 3.1 kg of natural gas every 100 km in the combined cycle. The CO2 emission levels are drastically reduced: 106 g/km for the petrol engine and 85 for the gas engine.\nIt combines the MultiAir, Turbo and downsizing technologies with specific technologies for natural gas power systems, and is the ideal solution for a customer who pays close attention to environmental issues but also seeks cost efficiency. Compared with the petrol version, the engine has added bespoke elements such as an inlet manifold, injectors, electronic engine control system and valve seats made of high resistance material. And it is indeed thanks to the perfect integration of all these components, together with the most advanced technologies – such as the MultiAir system and the turbo compressor – that maximum reliability can be ensured. This is also the factor that ensures that the performances and driving experience are not altered in any way when the car is powered by natural gas.\nFCA has been the leader in Europe for petrol-methane dual fuel vehicles for twenty years, with over 700 thousand sold vehicles and a range of six Fiat brand models (Panda, Punto, Qubo, Doblò, 500L and 500L Living), one from Lancia (Ypsilon) and four from Fiat Professional: Fiorino, Doblò Cargo, Ducato and Ducato Panorama.\nThe natural gas system reduces CO2 emissions by 23 per cent and nitrogen oxide emissions by 52 per cent compared with petrol driven engines.\nThe Tipo family\nThe Tipo family is more than capable of meeting the requirements of families, couples and young people thanks to its three body styles and its relevant, practical contents: a project centred on providing unrivalled value for money.\nThe 4Doors version has rewritten the rules of the market: a vehicle of truly great substance with an incredible quality to price ratio. The 5Doors model combines a dynamic style with ultra-high levels of comfort and versatility, while the Tipo Station Wagon is the roomiest, most flexible Fiat on the market, remaining loyal to the philosophy of the Tipo family, yet guaranteeing additional functionality and flexibility.\nThe range also offers ideal solutions for the professional world, thanks to the specific Easy Business and Business trims.\nIn addition to the Tipo 5Doors in the new S-Design trim, the stand at Geneva will also host a 4-door sedan in metallic \'Amore Red\' finish, fitted with the 1.6 E-Torq 110 HP engine, and automatic 6-gear transmission. The range is completed by an example of the Station Wagon version presented in Mediterraneo Blue livery, with a 1.6 Multijet 120 HP engine, combined with dual clutch automatic transmission.\nBoth vehicles are in the generously equipped \"Lounge\" version, with diamond cut 17 alloy wheel rims, chrome details and a leather steering wheel and gear shift knob for an even more refined touch.\nComfort and safety features include cruise control, brake control, front armrest and driver\'s seat with lumbar adjustment. The high-tech equipment is enhanced by the UconnectTM HD LIVE system, which on 5Door and Station Wagon cars comes with a 7 high-resolution colour touchscreen display and a capacitive screen that the user can pinch and swipe just like a tablet. The latest-generation system includes a hands-free Bluetooth interface, audio streaming, text reader and voice recognition, AUX and USB ports with iPod integration, controls on the steering wheel and, on demand, rear parking camera and the new TomTom 3D built-in navigation system.\nThe customer will always be connected with the UconnectTMLIVE services available on the touchscreen radio.\nUsers who download the free UconnectTMLIVE app from the App Store or Google Play Store onto their smartphone can fully exploit the benefits of UconnectTMLIVE, including music streaming with Deezer and TuneIn, news from Reuters, connected navigation with TomTom LIVE and the ability to stay in touch with friends via Facebook Check-in and Twitter. Besides savings, users can monitor their car\'s environmental performance and maintenance status wherever they are with eco:Drive and my:Car.\nThe UconnectTMsystem is now also available with the CarPlay and Android AutoTMsystems.Apple CarPlay allows the driver to use their iPhone in the car in the most intuitive way possible: it perfectly integrates the iPhone with the car\'s display and native controls. Now users will be able to make calls, play their music, send and receive messages, get directions optimised for traffic conditions and much more, while staying focused on the road.\nAndroid Auto will give the driver useful information organised in simple sheets that only appear when necessary. This function gives access to Google Maps with voice-guided navigation system, traffic information in real time, lane guidance; Google Play Music and many other music services; the ability to make and receive calls and send messages while keeping your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road. Android Auto and Google Play Music are registered trademarks of Google Inc.\nAll Tipo cars are also equipped as standard with six airbags, ESC and Hill Holder, TPMS tyre pressure monitoring system, rear parking sensors and fog lights. A full series of safety devices are featured in the model, complete with the Safety pack with autonomous Cruise Control, automatic emergency brake and Speed Limiter.\nFor the Tipo Station Wagon and the Tipo 5Door, the Business Trim is also available in two different versions: Easy Business and Business, which offer important additional features in terms of technology, comfort and safety. The first offers a driver’s seat with lumbar adjustment and power socket in the boot, as well as parking sensors, Cruise Control, Brake Control and Speed Limiter, UconnectTM infotainment system and 5\' NAV with Tom Tom 3D navigator. The new Business trim level offers UconnectTM NAV 7 HD LIVE, equipped with integrated Tom Tom 3D navigation system, rear parking sensors, lumbar adjustment for the driver\'s seat, fog lamps and an exclusive driver assist pack including Adaptive Cruise Control, Full Brake Control and Speed Limiter. The Business version sports 16\' alloy wheels, while 17\' alloy wheels are also available as an option, at no added cost.\nFiat 500S\nFiat 500S is the new sporty version of the Fiat icon, characterised by its bold look and full range of standard equipment. Available in two versions, sedan and convertible, the new model targets young motorists, mainly men, who seek a car with a strong sporty personality. In the last six months, S version cars have accounted for about 15 per cent of 500 sales in Europe. The 500S has a distinctive look, featuring front and rear bumpers in a sporty design, built-in fog lamps, bespoke spoilers and skirts and details in the exclusive \'Satin Graphite\' finish (such as the door and boot door handles, mirror caps and wheel trims), rear tinted windows, – for the sedan version–, the chrome exhaust cap, the front \'black-grained\' air vents and the bold honeycomb under grille.\nThe 15\' wheel rims are also bespoke and decorated with the specific \'Stain Graphite\' finish. Additionally, on request, the 16\' rims can feature a matte black diamond cut treatment.\nThe exclusive matte Alpi Green shade, which also characterises the 500X S-Design, enhances and highlights the aggressive design of the vehicle, and is only available for the sedan version.\nThe vehicle on the stand, in Italia Blue livery, is equipped with the 0.9 TwinAir 105 HP two-cylinder petrol engine, which results in low consumptions and emissions, while maintaining brilliant performances thanks to its super-charging ability. The 500S is also available with the 1.2 69 HP engine and the 1.3 Multijet turbodiesel 95 HP engine.\nFinally, the interior of the 500S stands out for its \'Satin Graphite\' details (such as the fascia of the dashboard), sporty bespoke steering wheel and the black combination of seats and ceiling, in contrast with the door panels and the edging on the seats, available in light blue, white and yellow. Frau leather interiors with white or light blue details are available on request.\nStandard UconnectTM 7 HD LIVE touchscreen system with \"tablet effect,\" HD display and UconnectTM LIVE services offered as standard. On request, digital radio (DAB) and 3D TomTom navigation system are also available. Since March, the UConnectTM system is also available with CarPlay and Android AutoTM systems.\nFiat 500L\nThe Fiat 500L completes the display of the 500 family, combining the style and functionality of Made in Fiat design with the iconic personality of the 500. A compact city car but one with a considerable amount of space, capable of combining practicality and personality: the ideal vehicle for the families of today. And the public have certainly put their money where their mouths are, judging by its performances in terms of sales: 500L has continued to confirm its status as European market leader in its segment every year, ever since it was launched. The Trekking version on display is characterised by two-colour livery and is decorated by the combination of chrome elements with a satin finish – the spoiler on the front and the handle of the boot door – and elements in matte black paint; from the mudguards to the skirts, from the 17\' alloy wheels to the front and rear bumpers. The painted red brake calipers complete the look.\nThe same distinctive style returns in the \'total black\' trim of the interior, where the black painted dashboard and the seats in bespoke fabric and black ecoleather with the \'500\' logo emblazoned on the front back rest stand out.\nThe vehicle on display features the BeatsAudioTM system, which boasts a total power of 520 Watt, divided between two 80 Watt mid-Woofer speakers (diameter 165 mm) positioned in the bottom part of the front door panel, two 40 Watt tweeter speakers (diameter 38 mm) positioned in the top of the front door panel, two 60 Watt full-range speakers (diameter 165 mm) positioned in the rear door panel and an 80 + 80 Watt subwoofer (diameter 165 mm) located in the boot – which ensures dynamic, powerful bass tones, maximising the listening experience for fans of a wide range of musical genres, from hip hop to soul. The picture is completed by an amplifier with DSP and 8 channels, featuring a built-in advanced equalisation algorithm capable of reproducing the entire spectrum of sound that an artist experiences in the recording studio.\nThis dynamic characterisation has a bold identity which is further enhanced by the brilliant 1.4 T-Jet 120 HP engine, ensuring excellent flexibility, even from the lowest speeds, and a fun driving experience.\nThe model on display is complete with Traction+ technology designed, together with the M+S \'snowflake\' tyres provided as standard equipment, to increase the vehicle’s traction on slippery ground.\nAll without forgoing the benefits in terms of space and functionality intrinsic to the 500L, the Fiat City Lounge that artfully encompasses the little pleasures and the grand emotions of life in one place – children, friends, journeys – thanks to a passenger space of 3.17 m3 and a large, well-designed boot with a storage capacity of no less than 455 litres.\nFiat Panda\nThe Geneva stand would not be complete without the Panda, which has headed the overall sales rankings on the Italian market since 2012 and was European 2016 best-seller in its segment, with a 14.9 per cent share of segment A and more than 190,000 cars sold. The secret of this success, which is continuing in 2017 with sales of 17,900 units in January, lies in an offer always in line with the key characteristics of the Fiat functional family: personality, convenience and simplicity. Ever since it was first introduced, Panda has stood out for its unmistakable personality and characteristic agreeability developed to emphasise its different spirits: city car and city-SUV. These temperaments are united by functionality and simplicity: very compact exterior dimensions, interior space exploited to the max and configurable to all transport needs, a wide choice of engines and interior and exterior colour combinations able to meet every requirement. Finally, a simple range of equipment enhanced by the new UconnectTM infotainment system with Bluetooth and dashboard cradle, which can be integrated with Android and iOS smartphones.\nThe stand will proudly display the \'pocket size SUV\', able to cope with every eventuality or route, an object lesson in style, efficiency, agility and compact size. The vehicle in question is the Fiat Panda Cross, which crams all the exclusiveness of the off-road vehicles in higher categories into just 370 centimetres of car. This car is simply one of a kind, because it teams a traction system and technical features which are ideal for off-road driving offering the performance and contents of an SUV, with the external dimensions, efficiency and easy handling of a city car. Not to mention a distinctive style that manages to combine rational design with thrilling driveability.\nThe vehicle on the stand sports the Gelato White exterior, with two-colour seats in grey fabric and brown ecoleather and a brown dashboard. It is fitted with a 0.9 cm3 TwinAir 90 HP 2-cylinder engine, which ensures power and flexibility on the road. The all-wheel drive car features the Electronic Differential Lock, having been the first to introduce this to the market.\nFiat stand\nThe stand in Geneva will be welcoming visitors with typical Italian elegance and style. The attractive, flowing lines of the design and its dynamic forms will highlight the cars on display, focusing on the Fiat 500 special 60th anniversary series, the Panda Natural Power and the Panda Cross and Fullback Cross, the ideal cars for off-road use. Duality is a core concept of the stand, a metaphor for the contrasting and complementary features that make up the Fiat brand\'s emotional and functional world.\nA selection of accessories made in collaboration with Mopar and merchandising products will be showcased in a dedicated area. Outstanding amongst these is the 500 line, designed to delight those who like to denote their leisure time in original, exclusive style. The cool and pop products include a sweatshirt with built-in earsets to make use even more practical and a cushion with a built-in speaker that can be connected to a smartphone to play the right soundtrack at all times. And the exhibition space dedicated to the Fiat 500 special 60th anniversary series will be enhanced by the \'Fiat 500 Gabsule Collection\". Visitors can buy an exclusive collection of bags, purses, beauty cases and key rings designed by Gabs and inspired by the characteristic coolness of the 500, paying tribute to its design and telling its story by displaying snapshots of its iconic details. The \'Tribute to 500 anniversary\' glasses created by Italia Independent will also be available for the first time: characterised by a traditional, round frame, they are inspired by vintage design, reinterpreted in a modern, elegant key. By distributing informative leaflets and special elements placed around the stand, the public can become acquainted with the products of FCA Bank, the financial company specialising in the automotive sector. The company operates on the main European markets—in Switzerland through FCA Capital Suisse SA—with a sole mission: supporting the sales of all Fiat and Chrysler Automobiles brand vehicles through innovative financial products and high added value services dedicated to dealer networks, private clients and companies.\n*Automotive World is not responsible for the content of this news release.\n2017-03-01\nIndia Thomas\n')[0m

Picture: Mark Brake\n“The only definitive way to confirm pregnancy in pandas is through a comprehensive ultrasound examination where a foetus can be seen in the last few weeks of a pregnancy,” she said.\n“While Fu Ni has allowed us to ultrasound her for short periods, and the ultrasounds showed some swelling of the uterus and placenta thickening, we weren’t able to confirm a foetus.\n“Over the weekend, she experienced a pseudo labour, and has since adopted a toy and spends the day cradling and holding it close to her chest, which is totally consistent with a pseudo pregnancy.\n“We’ll continue to monitor Fu Ni closely as she will now need time to recover and to eventually move on from her adopted toy.\n“This is Wang Wang and Fu Ni’s third genuine attempt at breeding and we remain determined to help them on their journey to parenthood.”\nZoos SA senior veterinarian Dr Ian Smith said the team was hopeful this time around after two successful artificial inseminations were carried out last year.\n“We were extremely pleased with last year’s artificial insemination procedures, with results again confirming that Wang Wang’s semen is of a high quality,” he said.\n“Artificial insemination has played an important role in the captive breeding of giant pandas around the world due to the species’ unique reproductive biology, but it doesn’t guarantee a pregnancy and subsequent birth.”\nZoos SA chief executive Elaine Bensted said she is hopeful for a Fu Ni pregnancy in the future.\n“We have always known that breeding the Southern Hemisphere’s only giant pandas was going to be incredibly challenging,” she said.\n“With less than 1864 giant pandas living in the wild, Wang Wang and Fu Ni are powerful ambassadors for their species and since arriving in Australia they’ve played an important part in international giant panda conservation.”\nOriginally published as False alarm: Giant panda Fu Ni’s pseudo-pregnancy\n')[0m

Enjoying the Pregnancy', 'September marks the end of my second trimester of pregnancy and the beginning of the third. Yeap, how fast time flies! Before I know it, I will be cradling my newborn and honestly, I am feeling excited just thinking about that moment.\nNonetheless, I tell myself to cherish each day as it passes and I am enjoying all the time I have now with my two precious darlings before their little brother arrives. Deep down, I know I have been very blessed not just with three kids, but the fact that my pregnancies have mostly been smooth - I feel in the pink of health and have the energy to run around, exercise, jump, swim, dance and play! They say a positive mindset makes all the difference and I believe in that too, so as much as I can, I think about the good things and remind myself to stay hopeful and cheery.\nIn this month\'s \"Happiness is...\", I share with you all the fun times I had and the happy memories I tried to create for my family of four before it comes a five.\n \n The haze has made it quite impossible to venture outdoors on some days and to keep safe, we opted for some air-conditioned fun instead. One Sunday, the hubby was not around and I brought the girls to Petite Park in City Square Mall followed by having yummy pasta for dinner (we seldom do that with the hubby because he prefers Chinese cuisine to Western) which made them squeal with delight.\n It\'s been quite a while since we went to the arcade and so one evening, we went to Changi Airport Terminal 3 for some finger-licking good, crispy chicken at 4 Fingers followed by hours of arcade fun! The good thing about these two is that other than kiddy games, they also don\'t mind pairing us up and playing more adult games like shooting, car racing, basketball and so on. \n I was also thankful to receive some Play-doh gifts from Hasbro which kept them busy and happy for hours just making colourful, sometimes out-of-shape cupcakes and macarons.\n \nThe girls also watched their first ever Hi-5 concert and were blown away by the Hi-5 House of Dreams! The good thing was we had some empty space in front of us and the two of them could stand up, jump, dance and sing throughout the concert.\n \n \nOn days when the air seemed better, we grabbed the opportunity to go out and Gardens by the Bay is always one of our favourites. We would have dinner at Satay by the Bay and then let the girls go on a night treasure hunt with their torches. Guess what were their so-called treasure? Well, ants, spiders, dead leaves, pebbles and anything that fascinated them. Of course, they much preferred the ones that could move!\n \n \n On the Hari Raya holiday, despite the fact that we were going for a holiday the next day and had not started packing in the least, we decided to head to the west and brought the kids to Science Centre. Though KidsStop was full and we had to miss it, we still thoroughly enjoyed watching Pandas: The Journey Home in the Omni-Theatre followed by exploring Science Centre itself - even if it was for the nth time. The show chronicles the journey of a panda from captivity to being released in the wild and when the mommy panda gave birth and the girls saw these tiny, pink, cute little babies, I could really sense their amazement and awe.\n As the little one is turning three and will be starting half-day school very soon, I am making extra effort to cherish our one-one-one mornings together. Sometimes we go out shopping, sometimes we play puzzles, sometimes we watch cartoons and sometimes we just laze around and not do much at all. Still, I am just happy to be right beside her and I know she feels the same too.\n \n \nYes, and as you might know, we made not just one, but two overseas trips this month! The first one was a road trip up to Club Med Cherating and we totally enjoyed the all-inclusive, family-friendly experience. (You can read my first post on our trip here and in case you don\'t know yet, the second post will be up soon and I have a family holiday package to give away too!)\nPersonally, I was just glad to go on this first vacation of the year and enjoy some family bonding time out of Singapore. I didn\'t really want to fly since we are saving up for the third baby, so we had to be contented with visiting nearby countries for the time being. Well, I do have to count my blessings because to have holiday sponsors coming in time and again for a small fry blogger like me, that is more than a dream come true already and I am so thankful for that.\n \n \n \n Good things come in pairs, right? We also got invited by HARRIS Resort Waterfront Batam to check out the new facilities after our first trip there last year. I always think that if I were the client, I wouldn\'t approach the same blogger twice so I could only be pleasantly surprised and deeply grateful that they did.\nI also invited my parents and in-laws to join us on the trip so we could celebrate my dad\'s birthday together too (no, their expenses were not sponsored and came from our own pockets). It warmed my heart to see them having the courage to try out new activities and having fun throughout. For the hubby and I, we managed to spend some rare couple time and went for a ATV ride, jet ski and a massage session too! (Some might think I was being crazy to do so but well, I had the support of the hubby and my parents who gave me the green light and in the first place, I knew best what I could or could not do. Yes, third time pregnant means I had more experience and knowledge of my own body, so please don\'t worry about me!) I will be sharing more on our trip soon! \n \n Last but not least, we rushed back in time from Batam to celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival the same evening. I heaved a sigh of relief when I managed to dig out the lanterns we made previously and went out to get candles and some low-smoke sparklers (these cost me $12,90! But I really didn\'t want to add to the haze) for the girls to have fun too! \n 八月十五庆中秋，一家团圆乐融融. \nSo September ended with yummy mooncake and a radiant smile. I\'m happy to now move on to the final lap of the pregnancy and I know things will just get more exciting from here.\n How was the month of September like for you? \n******\n  \n What are you HAPPY for this month?  \nHappy memories have a special way of touching our hearts every time we think  about them. Join in my linky party at the end of every month and let us  smile, rejoice and share the simple joys of life.

Under an agreement between China and the U.S., such panda cubs must be returned to China before they are 4 years old, the earliest age at which they might begin breeding.\nThe 3-year-old landed in the city of Chengdu in Sichuan province on Wednesday after a 16-hour flight in a Boeing 777 emblazoned with a picture of a giant bamboo-eating panda. She was accompanied by a veterinarian panda keeper Marty Dearie from the National Zoo, which had put on six days of commemorations to mark her departure.\nTransported to the nearby Dujiangyan panda breeding base, Bao Bao emerged from her crate looking somewhat timid and curious, but soon settled in with a snack of fresh bamboo, according to a news release from the China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Pandas.\nBao Bao, whose name means \"precious\" or \"treasure,\" will first go through a month-long quarantine at the Dujiangyan base, the research center said. Keepers will monitor her diet, activities and health during that time, including checking her blood and feces, it said.\n\"Once Bao Bao the panda completes this month of quarantine, she\'ll go on display to the public and I welcome everyone to come see her then,\" research center expert Li Desheng was quoted as saying in the news release.\nA 100-square meter (1,100-square foot) enclosure has been prepared for her at the base, including both indoor and outdoor play areas, equipped with rubber balls and a tires swing for entertainment and fresh bamboo and apples for eating.\nKeepers will work on helping Bao Bao adapt to local bamboo and Chinese steamed bread made from corn, soybeans, rice and eggs, the official Xinhua News Agency said.\nShe is the 11th panda to be born overseas and returned to China, and since she does not understand commands in Chinese, she\'ll be looked after for a time by an English-speaking keeper, Xinhua said.\nChina\'s unofficial national mascot, giant pandas live mainly in the mountains of Sichuan, with some also found in neighboring Gansu and Shaanxi provinces.\nThey have long considered one of the world\'s most endangered animals, although last year a leading international group lowered its classification to \"vulnerable.\"\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature cited conservation efforts that helped the wild panda population jump to 1,864 in 2014 from 1,596 in 2004. However, the Chinese government rejected the group\'s decision, saying the panda\'s status was no less serious because its natural habitats have been splintered by human and natural causes.\nMore than 200 giant pandas also live in captivity.\n')[0m

This brought joy not only to animal lovers, at the thought that a baby panda might be forthcoming, but also to Totenko Co., proprietors of a Chinese restaurant within walking distance of the zoo.\nAlthough brief, announcement of the 52-second mating session of pandas Shin Shin and Ri Ri caused the value of the company\'s stock to surge 9.9 percent in afternoon trading, Bloomberg reported. The stock saw a 2.9 percent increase in trading volume upon closing, which is almost five times more than the three-month average.\nThis isn’t the first time the company has seen a stock increase related to panda mating. In 2012, Shin Shin gave birth to a cub, causing a spike in stock prices, but it died six days later from pneumonia, South China Morning Post reported. A year after the cub\'s death, Totenko\'s stock price increased again when the zoo announced that Shin Shin may have been pregnant again — but dipped a month later, after it was revealed she wasn’t pregnant after all.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the economic impact of pandas, pregnant or not, on local businesses has been estimated at $89 million annually.\nClick for slideshow\n10 Best Restaurants in Japan\n')[0m

Longtime CHLA supporter Kim Kardashian West joined the hospital to kick off the campaign, which has attracted the commitment of more than 100 businesses in Los Angeles and the Coachella Valley. The month-long community fundraising drive is helping local businesses rally community participation to raise $1 million in the month of March to support children\'s health in Los Angeles and surrounding communities.\n\"Make March Matter is a movement uniting companies and individuals to bring awareness to the healthcare needs of children and to maintain the programs and services at CHLA that address those needs,\" says Children\'s Hospital Los Angeles president and CEO Paul Viviano. \"We are fortunate to have such a compassionate and loyal group of partners helping us to fulfill our mission of creating hope and building healthier futures for our patients and their families.\"\nEach year, CHLA treats children who face a broad range of health issues, from common illnesses to traumas to chronic diseases. The hospital is also dedicated to innovation, supporting advances in research designed to improve pediatric health outcomes and partnering with physicians across the nation to bring the best care here to children in Los Angeles.\nThe hospital relies on the generosity of the community to support its groundbreaking pediatric research and the complex care it provides for critically ill and injured children. Last year, 67 local business and corporate partners helped the inaugural campaign exceed its $1 million goal, raising a total of $1.3 million to aid in funding life-saving care for children in Los Angeles.\nHere\'s how the community and individuals can help Make March Matter:\nSupport the businesses that support CHLA. For a complete list of the more than 100 participating partners and local events taking place throughout the month of March, go to MakeMarchMatter.org .\nMake a donation at MakeMarchMatter.org .\nIndividuals may share how they are participating in the campaign on social platforms using #MakeMarchMatter\nCorporate Partners\nCorporations across the southland have agreed to support community members in giving back. Each business has selected a unique way to contribute to the campaign\'s collective impact-some sell specific items with proceeds supporting CHLA patients, others devote a portion of overall sales for the entire month and still others create their own unique fundraising campaigns to galvanize their employees and consumers to contribute.\n\"Panda Restaurant Group is honored to be part of Children\'s Hospital Los Angeles\' Make March Matter campaign again this year,\" says Calvin Lee, vice president of Operations. \"Giving is one of Panda\'s core values and it inspired our associates\' passion to raise $350,000 to help children in need last year. We are committed to be the campaign\'s top fundraiser again in 2017.\"\nBy visiting, shopping and dining with a business supporting #MakeMarchMatter, individuals can activate donations to support the care of patients at CHLA.

Cleaning up of the hill shrine ahead of the Chaitra festival was formally started on Wednesday.\nCleaning up started\nSenior officials of administration, including the district collector and authorities of the Tara Tarini Development Board (TTDB), took part in the cleaning process.\nCleaning of the hill shrine was started from the foothill and in the coming days the whole hill is expected to be cleaned up.\nTTDB secretary Pramod Panda said it has been decided to make the hill shrine completely polythene-free during the festival.\nAll shops at the foothill and the hilltop have been informed about the perils of polythene use. All visitors to the hill shrine would also be requested to refrain from throwing polythene bags and other non-biodegradable materials in the hill shrine region. The local tehsildar has been tasked to ensure minimal use of polythene at the hill shrine.\nTo avoid traffic jam\nDuring Tuesdays of the Chaitra festival, ten buses would be provided by TTDB for transportation of devotees to the hilltop through the ghat road. Ticket for the to-and-fro journey would be ₹ 50 per passenger. Except for these buses and a few vehicles used for official purposes, no other vehicle would be allowed to travel to the hilltop.\nThis is being done to avoid traffic congestion on the ghat road during the festival days. A ropeway and traditional steps also lead to the top of the hill shrine.\nIt has also been decided that the irrigation department would release some water from the barrages in the Surada area so that the Rushikulya river at the foothill contains adequate water for the bathing of the devotees on Tuesdays of the Chaitra festival.\nOn these days, three temporary medical centres would be opened at Tara Tarini.\nRelated Articles\nPlease Wait while comments are loading...\nComments will be moderated by The Hindu editorial team.\nComments that are abusive, personal, incendiary or irrelevant cannot be published.\nPlease write complete sentences.

Provided it addresses border-security concerns, the time has come for conservatives to embrace a reform measure—and the reasons are not just political; they are economic as well.\nAfter the Senate’s \'Gang of Eight\' released its immigration-reform principles, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, stated that it would \'cost Americans their jobs when they have to compete with millions of more [immigrants] for scarce jobs.\' Implicit in his assumption is that immigrants \'take\' jobs from Americans. But that is untrue.\nBut if immigrants \'take\' jobs from Americans, then so must any new entrant in the workforce also take a job from another American. If the number of jobs is fixed and adding new labor just increases unemployment—which would be the logical conclusion to this argument—unemployment should increase over time as the population grows. The reality is the precise opposite.\nFrom 1948 to 2012, the size of the U.S. labor force went from 60 million to 156 million—a two-and-a-half-fold increase. Over the same time, the number of people employed in the U.S. labor market has increased from 58 million to 148 million. There would be about 90 million fewer employed Americans today than there are if new workers entering the labor market actually prevented older workers from getting jobs.\nThe time has come for conservatives to embrace immigration reform —and the reasons are not just political; they are economic as well.\nThis 90 million net gain in jobs since 1948 is impossible to explain for people claiming that immigrants \'take jobs\' from Americans.\nThe large increase in the size of the U.S. labor market has been due to two phenomena: the increased entry of women into the labor force, and immigration. After World War II, women began to enter the labor force in dramatic numbers, rising from 17 million women in 1948 to 73 million in 2012—a more thanr fourfold increase in little over 60 years. Women went from a paltry labor-force participation rate of 33 percent to 58 percent.\nDuring the same time, male workers went from 43 million to 76 million workers, increasing by a far more modest 77 percent. The male labor-force participation rate, however, has declined from 87 percent to 70 percent, reflecting the aging of the workforce, the Great Recession, and government assistance for the unemployed. What’s clear, though, is that the economy created jobs for both men and women over the decades.\nImmigration has also swelled the labor force. In 1950, immigrants numbered about 10 million and were roughly 7 percent of the population. Today there are 40 million immigrants, and they constitute 13 percent of the population. An average of 600,000 legal immigrants have come here annually since 1948, accompanied by a smaller but substantial number of unauthorized immigrants.\nBut the data are even more positive than that. During this time the proportion of the U.S. population that is employed has increased by 2 percentage points. Furthermore, the labor-force participation rate, the percentage of Americans employed or looking for a job any given month, is 5 percentage points greater in 2012 than it was in 1948—an astonishing increase considering our moribund economy.\nWomen did not \'take\' the jobs of American men when they entered the labor force, and neither have immigrants. The total size of the U.S. workforce and the number of people employed have increased dramatically over the decades. Recessions and periods of slow employment growth, such as the 1970s and the Great Recession, produce kinks in that trend, but it is unmistakably positive.\nImmigrants, like native-born American women and men, create jobs by starting businesses and consuming and producing goods and services. According to the Kauffman Foundation, immigrants are more than twice as likely to start a business as native-born Americans. High-tech firms like Google, cofounded by Russian immigrant Sergey Brin, and low-tech ones like Panda Express, founded by the Cherng family from Taiwan, employ Americans and create goods and services that Americans want.\nImmigrants’ skills often complement American ones, meaning that when immigrants and natives work together, both produce more and earn higher wages than if they were working in separate countries. Immigration does not divide a fixed pie of wealth; it increases wealth, incomes, and job opportunities for everybody.\nThe view that workers, whether women or immigrants, \'take\' jobs is a new iteration of the old socialist notion—the basis for class warfare—that there is a fixed and static pie of wealth to be divided by some wise central planner. This notion was debunked by free-market economists more than a century ago. It’s time for opponents of immigration reform like Rep. Smith to learn that lesson and trust the market to regulate immigration flows better than the government.\n')[0m

All of them completed the trip in stipulated time of 27 hours and qualified for the ‘400 km Brevets De Randonneurs Mondiaux (BRM)’ certification.\nStarting from Vaishno Dham temple, Bicholi Mardana, Indore, the cyclists rode from Indore to Manpur and crossed Indore again to head for Sehore and finally completed the ride at Indore. Sharing his experience of the trip, Dr Rajpal Singh said, \'Terrain was tougher than expected, as wind was blowing against us, across our ride.\' He explained that cross blowing wind can easily topple a cyclist, but since they were riding together, they were able to battle it.\nind, bad part about the ride was traffic,\' Singh said. He said that rashly driven trucks were cornering them, pushing them down the road. Highlighting the positive points of the ride, Dr Raju Keswani, \'Kids were chasing us and willing to participate in the ride.\' He said that riding is the best way to encourage cycling culture.\n\n\n\'People gave us dry fruits and appreciated our efforts,\' Keswani said adding that people even took selfies with them, treating them like celebrities. The biggest problem that they faced during the trip, Manish Jain, general manager of a company, said, \'Highways do not have proper light, which is dangerous for all commuters.\' He elaborated that it was difficult to ride in darkness on the route.\nLooking at the brighter side, engineer Raghunandan Panda said, \'It was not sunny so it was fun to look at the scenic views.\' He recalled that people called them crazy, but they simply smiled back. \'As cyclists, we are already proving who is crazy, so it was funny to hear that,\' Panda added. However, he felt that people should at least learn to respect cyclists enough, not to throw them off the track.\nThrilled by the roller coaster ride, engineering student Amol Sodani said, \'Track from Badnawar to Ratlam had a lot of ups and downs, which resembled a roller coaster ride.\' He added that the only difference was that they controlled the ride. Sharing the lesson he learnt during the trip, Sodani said, \'For me, it was a new challenge and I crossed another milestone, as a randonneur.\' Cycling has become an important part of his life.\nISSUES\n■ Insufficient lighting on roads\n')[0m

This year\'s Cash Princes list, which was shared today (Mar. 1), includes Lil Yachty ,\nThe emphasis on this year\'s list was definitely Internet rappers making real life checks. Brooklyn rapper and 2016 XXL Freshman Desiigner signed a record deal based off the viral success of his first song \"Panda\" , the track that earned him a 2017 Grammy nomination . Lil Uzi Vert, another 2016 Freshman , was the most-followed rapper on SoundCloud in 2016 and his digital drops have translated to real life co-signs and collabs. At 19 years old, Lil Yachty has made a ton of big business moves this year, proving he\'s got a marketable personality for brands like Sprite , Target and Nautica .\nThis year\'s recipients also include rising stars hailing from all over the world. The U.K.\'s Stormzy just dropped his debut album Gang Signs and Prayer and is successfully breaking into the American rap market in a big way.\n\"Stormzy gets and understands the bigger picture and isn\'t afraid to broaden his horizons,\" Little Simz, a former Cash Princes member, told Forbes. \"He is an inspiration to many and there no limitations on how far he will take it, because he\'s doing this on his own terms.\"\nIn order to make it onto the Forbes Cash Princes list, the artist must be primarily classified as a rap/R&B act, must be under 30 years old and must not have appeared on the list in years prior.

This allow users to upload and engage with video content based on their interest, while connecting with like-minded individuals both regionally and globally. \n\n Following the rapid rise in demand for online video content, the site was born when Acer and Stefan often found their friends posting videos of their passion, whether it be cycling or wakeboarding, on other social networks were met with a complete lack of interest. This led the pair to create HighlyRated.com, where users are encouraged to Rate or Hate videos based on their merit. Videos that are then the most ‘rated\' will appear on the site\'s homepage, providing the user with higher visibility and connectivity. \n\n Commenting on HighlyRated.com\'s launch, Co-Founder and CEO Acer Jamal said, \"Beta testing of the site was beyond positive – even with very optimistic expectations, we\'re delighted with the response so far. Having lived in the UAE on & off for over 20 years, we chose to launch our Middle East office here in UAE due to its reputation as a hub for entrepreneurship. The Middle East is our focus before we expand outward, instead of the other way round, which has been the case with nearly every other social network.\" \n\n Users are now encouraged to sign up for the video-based social network by visiting www.HighlyRated.com . They can then immediately begin creating their own network by following the site\'s motto of Rate, Create and Participate. \n\n About HighlyRated.com: \n\n HighlyRated.com is a 100% privately owned video-based social media network founded by 2 dedicated entrepreneurs and features numerous categories that cover a multitude of interests. Users can Rate or Hate the video content & directly interact with each other. The site is dedicated to bringing people from all over the world together to share their experiences, passion and laughter – proving that our shared interests bring us together more than they set us apart. \n\n For Media Contact: \n Acer Jamal \n +971 50 301 4794 \n Acer@highlyrated.com\nSubmitted by:Acer Jamal Disclaimer: Pressbox disclaims any inaccuracies in the content contained in these releases.

Gray Design looks to mend that hole in the practically dead brand’s lineup by imagining a high-tech Swedish coupe that it calls the AiroX. Advanced artificial intelligence could help a driver be even faster around a track.\nOther than the grille, Gray Design’s styling for the AiroX doesn’t take many cues from classic Saabs. The screen in the front end for showing messages is a weird touch, though. Instead, the model looks more like a classic supercar with a low roof and mid-mounted powertrain. However, this vehicle borrows more inspiration from Saab’s history as an aircraft company.\n\n\n\nMovable wings and flaps would adjust the aerodynamics for the vehicle to slice through the air. According to Gray Design, pieces at the front would adjust the downforce there. The deployable panels at the back would extend at high speed for extra stabilization.\nThe chance of Saab actually building a supercar is fairly low because the company’s current parent is National Electric Vehicle Sweden having enough problems just reviving the 9-3 as an electric car. In late January 2017, the firm claimed that it had an order for supplying 150,000 units of the EV to China’s Panda New Energy. Production is supposed to begin at a new factory by the end of 2017.\n\n\n\nSaab forged a legacy of being a quirky brand with a dedicated fan following. General Motors later bought the brand and eventually tried to make the company more mainstream. The attempt failed, and the General sold off the firm. Spyker also briefly held ownership before going into bankruptcy. Then, NEVS tried to pick up the pieces, but it hasn’t bee able to revitalize Saab yet.\nNEVS can’t even use the Saab name on future vehicles because the automaker’s complex history means that the moniker\'s ownership is split between the car company and the defense contractor. The plane builder revoked permission to use the trademark due to the automotive firm’s financial problems.\nSource: Gray Design\nMore Saab News:\n')[0m

Known as TES52, and built by Ely-based Megahertz for the TV OB arm of BT Media & Broadcast, the vehicle has already been used up to three times a week in the coverage of Premier League football matches around the country.\n\'There is considerable interest in UHD, and during the past year we have provided services with existing vehicles to five different broadcasters in the UK,\' explains Mark Wilson-Dunn, vice president at BT Media & Broadcast. \'However, this new truck is the first vehicle to be designed for one particular customer who had the requirement for three UHD fibre vision feeds and one satellite connection at the same time. Of course, having said that, it can be used for other applications, too. Using BT’s own fibre network, we can connect to over 150 major sports venues across the UK.\'\nAt each of those venues, the new truck will be located next to the outside broadcast production vehicle, accepting multiple feeds which are then compressed, multiplexed and fed to the broadcaster via the BT Tower in London.\nMaking choices\n\nTES52 is a step up from the TES51 UHD truck that Megahertz built in 2014. That truck was based on a Mercedes Sprinter framework, while the new vehicle is slightly larger and is built on a 7T Iveco Daily chassis.\n\'We did a review of the market before selecting Megahertz again for this work – but decided that the company offered the best solution to our unique requirements,\' states Wilson-Dunn.\nStephen Burgess, CTO at Megahertz takes up the story, \'Our challenge as a systems integrator is always to remain mindful of the weight of the equipment going into the vehicle. What’s more, we must ensure that there is sufficient space and cooling facilities for all the equipment and thereafter to provide the wiring requirements to connect everything together.\'\nHe reports that all vehicles need to have a reliable power source in order to perform well – and continuously. \'Megahertz chose the Fischer Panda 12000NE PVMH 10.6 kW / 12.5 kVA generator mounted inside a GRP  4DS super-silent capsule. The performance and reliability of the Fischer Panda combined with our considerable experience in fitting and maintaining these units, gave BT the confidence they needed for this vital part of the truck.\'\nAnother challenge involved the choice of antenna to meet the high specification for the BT truck. \'We needed to find an antenna that provided high gain and stability and be able to operate in harsh environmental conditions. We opted for the 1.8M AVL antenna, which met all the operational criteria from wherever the vehicle would be operating,\' states Burgess.\nWhen it came to selecting a router, the Megahertz team opted for the Snell Vega 3G unit. \'All modern SNG vehicles need to be flexible in the signal being fed into and routed through the system,\' says Burgess. \'The advantage of the Snell router proved to be invaluable. The flexibility of having a non-symmetrical router and being able to mix and match copper and fibre I/O’s allowed Megahertz to provide a very customised solution and the ability to add or remove or change the I/O configuration as the customer’s needs require.\'\nThe TES52 monitors multiple signals via a 4K Miranda multi-viewer on to a Sony 4K screen, with two 4K/HD Marshall monitors for additional qualitative signal monitoring and an HD Phabrix for test signal generation and checking. The truck supports up to sixteen fibre links in HD mode, or three 4K/UHD and four HD links, using the intelligent video networking platform (IVNP) and BT\'s core MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) network. Its on-board, 192-port Snell router is capable of handling a mixture of 4K, 3gbps and HD baseband signals, and ASI transport streams.\nOther equipment on board the vehicle includes a Peak PBU, Xicom HPAs, an ETL L-Band Router, a Marshall 4K Monitor and Bluebell Optical Splitters and converters.\nMaintaining quality\n\nWilson-Dunn continues, \'We live and die by the quality and reliability of the service we offer, so we have, wherever the appropriate equipment is available, remained with those suppliers that have a proven track record with us.\'\nHe goes on to report that during IBC, BT tested an Ericsson HEVC encoder with this truck. \'We used a demo unit and carried by fibre and satellite a live rugby match to Amsterdam. This was the first live demo of a HEVC based link used in the delivery of 4K UHD TV. Using this encoding/decoding technology removes the requirement for complex AVC quadrant based UHDTV contribution.\nSimilar stories\n')[0m

The children’s activities, led by Boys Scout Troop 333 Scoutmaster Bob McClain, kicked off around 12:30 p.m. with the five and under \'shoe-finding-scramble\', directly followed by the 6-8 year-olds’ sack race. Participants were rewarded with prizes ranging from bouncy balls to toy cars. Though not as many children participated than in past years, McClain believed the games to be a success.\n\'I think it went very well,\' McClain said. \'Everyone who came out and participated had a great time.\'\nFood and drinks were available for purchase at the north end of the park. Patrons could choose from a variety of options provided by Boy Scout Troops 007 and 139, Girl Scout Troop 3981, and Panda Express.\nThough the festivities were not much different than in years past, many South Pasadena residents expressed that this was not a problem. Some stressed that the \'sameness\' of the celebration is actually part of what makes it great. South Pasadena High School Junior Katia Hise agreed.\n\'Over the years, I have made so many memories at Garfield Park on the Fourth of July,\' Hise said. \'And I love being able to count on having these festivities year after year.\'\nCitizens celebrate Independence Day with activities in the park was last modified: July 5th, 2015 by\nTiger Staff\n')[0m

The list includes hip-hop’s most balling newcomers. The only credentials they need to satisfy are being classified as rap/hip-hop, fall under thirty years of age and weren’t previously featured on the prince or king\'s version of the list.\nThe most shocking names on the list are probably Young M.A. and Noname. Surprising because of gender, not because of talent, status or bank account statements. Young M.A. was probably one of the most talked-about rappers of the past year with her hit track, \'Ooouuu\' going double platinum and finding a home as a soundtrack to one of Queen Bey’s outfit GIFs  on Instagram. Not mention she opened up for Mrs. Carter on her Formation Tour on the Metlife Stadium stop.\nREAD: Young M.A. Lands The Cover Of ‘The FADER’s’ First Ever \'Sex Issue\'\nNoname has received a co-sign from music’s streaming hero, Chance The Rapper, and earned a spot on his Grammy-winning album, Coloring Book.

This is significant, IBM added, as organized cybercrime gangs using banking Trojans will be likely to adopt the same method in the future.\nWhat\'s more, Dridex\'s developers also worked on a major upgrade to the malware\'s configuration encryption. This upgrade includes implementing a modified naming algorithm, a robust but easy-to-spot persistence mechanism and a few additional enhancements.\nSpeaking to Infosecurity Luis Corrons, PandaLabs technical director, Panda Security , said the Dridex update is clear proof that cyber-criminals continually \"keep up to date with new technologies, and try to get advantages of them to make their attacks better.\"\n\"The release of a major version upgrade is a big deal for any software, and the same goes for malware,\" IBM added. \"The significance of this upgrade is that Dridex continues to evolve in sophistication, investing in further efforts to evade security and enhance its capabilities to enable financial fraud.\n\"We noted that special attention was given to dodging antivirus (AV) products and hindering research by adopting a series of enhanced anti-research and anti-AV capabilities.\"\nThe changes to Dridex\'s code injection method are among the most significant enhancements in v4. They allow Dridex to propagate in the infected endpoint with minimal calls to marked API functions, said IBM.\n')[0m

I’m basically a sofa warrior. I’m not in shape, no sir, nor am I particularly healthy - I don’t eat a lot of junk food but my diet isn’t something people are going to write about.\nSo what’s up with Kung Fu? Before I can answer any questions about my desire to get started with this incredibly cool martial art, I need to talk about what led me to feel it was time for me to make some positive, healthful changes in my life.\nFirstly, and this is a big thing for me - I have a chronic stomach condition, and while I mostly go about my day in the same way I always have, severe pain caused by the ilness has forced me to forgo a lot of wonderful opportunities. Camping is out of the question, and unless there’s plenty of reliable bathroom breaks road trips can be very tricky. Exercise can decrease inflammation, and while some postures might be painful at first - I think Kung Fu is going to help me control my flare-ups.\nSecondly, and this is just as big - I don’t have a lot of energy. I’m a writer, I work from an office and I often find myself daydreaming about naps before I’ve even had lunch. I know that I should eat better, but unless you combine diet and exercise you aren’t giving your body enough reasons to stop acting like a bag of potatoes. A Snickers bar does sound good right about now.\nThirdly, I’ve tried the gym. I hate the gym. It’s boring! Unless you’re some kind of psychopath, Netlfix and a comfy sofa (throw some Ben & Jerry’s in the mix) beat a mind-numbing sweaty run on the treadmill.\nFourthly - I didn’t intend for this to be a list but hey, life’s funny that way.\nFithly, As a writer of this type of articles I had the opportunity to compare every martial art in 500 words. Kung Fu won hands down. I mean Karate seems a little boring, and I don’t have the stomach to cope with a bunch of grappling techniques like those in Judo and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu . Kung Fu includes Tai Chi which just looks very relaxing. Also - do you remember the Kung Fu Panda movies? Of course you do! Well those animals are based on real Kung Fu techniques named after the animals they emulate.\nI’m not going to list more reasons - for 2 reasons! (See the irony?) One, my job only pays me to write short articles. Two, I don’t really think I need to offer up more reasons I think Kung Fu would be perfect for me. What I will say is that I hope that reading about some of my considerations will help you choose the best exercise or martial art for you. We’re all different, there’s not one fight technique better than the other - but if you want to choose one definitely take a look at some Kung Fu fighting techniques on YouTube. They’re awesome. \n\n\n\n')[0m

After consolidating its market leadership in China , NetEase Games is looking to expand further overseas. When discussing the overseas strategy for NetEase Games, NetEase CEO Ding Lei mentioned that he has ambitious goals to achieve greater results in the non-Chinese gaming markets within the next three to five years.\nTo show their dedication toward overseas markets, NetEase sent its dream team of lead developers for five flagship games to the event.

Regardless of your actual heritage, everyone\'s a little bit Irish during the weekend. You might think it\'s simply a time to wear green, drink at an Irish pub and follow a leprechaun to the pot of gold. But it is also about good spirits and friendship and faith in the future - just as prayed for by St. Patrick.\nThis year the Luck O\' the Irish will be manifest in the form of everything from mass services indicating the religious adoration of St. Patrick - patron saint and national apostle of Ireland - to musical concerts. The holiday, nevertheless, will be most noticeable by wearing green, eating traditional Irish dishes, and drinking green beer and cocktails.\nThe annual Denver St. Patrick\'s Day Parade that steps off on March 11 is one of the largest St. Paddy\'s Day parades west of the Mississippi, and the biggest annual parade in Denver. In recognition of its 55th year, this year\'s parade theme is The Emerald Celebration. More than 250,000 people are expected to line the streets of LoDo to see horses and stagecoaches, marching bands, dancers, quirky floats and Irish-themed characters.\nEmerald Parade\nAt 9:30 a.m. the parade exits onto Wynkoop from the Coors Field parking lot onto 19th St. (behind Denver Chophouse). The parade proceeds on Wynkoop to 17th St. and takes a left on 17th to Blake, and finally ends at 27th St. and Blake. The best place for families to watch the parade is on Blake St. between 23rd to 27th Avenues. If you plan on staying for the entire parade, remember that the weather changes quickly so it is a good idea to dress in layers. In over 50 years of parade history it has only snowed twice. The temperature average is in the 60s on parade day.\nTo avoid traffic and parking issues it is also a good idea to arrive early. Close-in parking often fills up an hour or more before the parade starts. To make parking easy and stress-free, the parade committee has partnered with Parking Panda, allowing parade goers to purchase guaranteed parking passes at several lots and garages near the parade.\nAdrian Farrell is again the Grand Marshal of the parade. He is Ireland\'s first Consul General to the U.S. Southwest. The Consulate\'s priorities are to advance Irish economic initiatives and partnerships between Ireland and states of the Southwest U.S. Also in the parade is Laura Farley, this year\'s Queen Colleen. She will serve as spokesperson for the parade committee and attends a variety of events during her yearlong reign. A Denver native, she earned degrees in Criminal Justice and Psychology from Metro State U. She attended St. Brendan\'s School of Irish Dance beginning at age 10, continuing until she reached the rank of champion.\nLet The Green Begin\nThe City and County of Denver will kick off St. Paddy\'s activities on March 6 with a Proclamation Ceremony at the City & County Bldg. The proclamation is signed during a regular City Council session. The lighting of the Denver City & County Building to green will also take place. The session is scheduled to begin at noon.\nA Changing of the Sign Ceremony at the corner of 20th and Blake follows on March 9. Each year the City renames Blake Street \"Tooley Street,\" in celebration of St. Patrick\'s Day. The change is in honor of the late Dale Tooley - longtime Denver District Attorney, one-time mayoral candidate and full-time Irishman. This usually takes place between noon and 3 p.m.\nThen Lassies and Laddies get their Luck on March 12 for the Runnin\' Of The Green benefiting Volunteers of America, 10:15 a.m.-2 p.m. Considered the kickoff to the Denver running season, it is one of the largest 7K races in the nation.

E!\nOr, to be more precise, two unlikely partners - of the panda variety. \"Cheng\" and \"Long\" are the two Chinese characters in Chan\'s name in Mandarin.\nBut like everything else which goes on on that red carpet, there was a pretty simple explanation for it all - it was all in aid of his role as panda ambassador. He apparently has plans to auction them for charity - that is, if he can ever bear to part with them.\n')[0m

Constant Con creates a comic-con style atmosphere and community year round.\nBy Alec Kuehnle\nPublished Mar 1, 2017 6:00am\nAlthough not everyone may realize it, Tucson has a lot of creative talent. For example, if you happen to take to take a stroll down Sixth Avenue downtown, you might come across Constant Con, the place where it’s Comic-Con year-round, a prime example of the artistic creativity that makes Tucson tick.\nConstant Con began in December 2015. It is a collective art gallery/comic book store/fun house and gives local creative minds a chance to display their work. The work ranges from digital art to pop art to concept art to comic books and everything in between, often pertaining to films, cartoons or video games.\n\'I noticed there was a lot of us in the Comic-Con community here,\' said Frank Powers, founder of Constant Con. \'We all know each other in one way or another, and the community is pretty tight-knit.\'\nThe different artists with work on display at Constant Con split the rent of the downtown property, providing an opportunity for up-and-coming artists or anyone else with creative tendencies to have their work on display.\nRELATED: \'Stranger Things\' fan art comes to life at Xpanded Universe\nAbout seven artists originally displayed their creations at the store and now many have come and gone, which is all part of the process.\n\'Your stuff is always for sale and there is always someone here to sell it for you,\' Powers said. \'Comics are considered low art by some, so for us to have this in a gallery setting really makes a difference.\'\nIan Green | The Daily Wildcat\nAn assortment of artwork featured in Constant Con, located on 6th Ave. by Pennington Street.\nSome of the artists visit every single weekend, while others only come in to pay the rent once a month. Some of them use the space as their downtown office, while others just want to display their work. Either way, Constant Con gives them the tools they need to get their work noticed.\n\'You have your buddies that you get to see at the different cons throughout the year, but this place keeps that community going year-round,\' said Edward Marrano, a digital artist with work currently on display at Constant Con.\nMarrano’s art can also be found at cyberviking.artstation.com.\n\'I fell in love with the design process even more than the end product,\' Marrano said. \'I have really fallen in love with the art behind it. I do characters, environments, landscapes and I focus a lot on sci-fi.\'\nPowers created the character Pissed OFF Panda, a character with comics and merchandise available for sale at Constant Con.\n\'I was at the San Diego Zoo and I basically met Pissed OFF Panda,\' Powers said. \'I go to the gift shop and see all these goofy-looking toy pandas. I see one and it looks pissed off, and I’m like, ‘it’s Pissed OFF Panda.’\'\nThe character will be featured in an ongoing independent comic book, according to the Pissed OFF Panda Facebook page.\n\'I’m a super positive guy, so he is my outlet to get my frustrations out without having to post it on Facebook,\' Powers said with a smile.\nMost people involved in the Comic-Con world can only show their work at a few conventions each year, so for the rest of the time, the work is just sitting there, an idea that Powers finds ridiculous.\n\'I don’t believe in the idea of the starving artist,\' he said.\nConstant Con has even more to offer than just an art cooperative. The business also offers classes, birthday parties and events around town. Of course, these events do require money. People can help financially support Constant Con at patreon.com/frankpowers .\nConstant Con will host the Animated Arizona Film Festival March 31 and April 1 at the Screening Room, and they host F!ed Up every Wednesday at R Bar. Powers has a radio show every Saturday night on 99.1 FM from 11 p.m.-1 a.m., and he does the show live once a month at the Screening Room.\nRELATED: UA alumnus, \'The Lebowski Cycle\' artist Joe Forkan to present process behind his paintings at UAMA\n‘We have had an overwhelmingly positive reaction from the public, so I just want more people to know about us,\' Powers said.\nHe also has plenty of ideas for expanding Constant Con and knows what he wants it to achieve in the future. A brand-new Constant Con website will launch within a few months, and the business can be found as ConstantConHQ on Twitter and Instagram .\nIan Green | The Daily Wildcat\nConstant Con features an eclectic assortment of many creative works, ranging from comic book characters, to concept art to the steampunk genre. The shop promotes a space for the community celebrating all things comic-culture, promoting local artists and independent work.\nThe business even has a pet goldfish named Mr. Mangold, who Powers refers to as the boss of Constant Con.\n\'I don’t want to be the boss,\' Powers said. \'We’re a partnership. Mangold is the boss.\'\nWhether you love comics or just want to see something cool, make sure to stop by Constant Con on your next downtown stroll.\n\'It might sound crazy, but there is almost a mini version of Hollywood that I can see here in Tucson,\' Powers said.\n')[0m

Scientists have proposed dozens of reasons for the animals’ piebald appearance. They could be warnings, like the black and white stripes on skunks. Or they could be used for camouflage, communication, eye protection, or regulating body heat. To find out which ideas were on the mark, scientists compared panda pelage to the dark and light coloring of 195 other terrestrial carnivore species and 39 bear subspecies, and then matched their patterns against environmental conditions and social behaviors. The scientists did not find a link between temperature and coat color; nor did they find an association between black eye markings and daytime glare. But they did find a connection between lighter colors and snow cover, suggesting that the giant panda’s white markings help hide the animal in snowy habitats , they report today in Behavioral Ecology. Meanwhile, their darker markings likely hide them in the forest, where they are preyed on by predators like leopards. Pandas evolved both colors as a kind of compromise, the scientists argue, because they are active year-round in both habitats. But what about the face patches? The analysis indicates that markings on carnivores’ heads are not used for camouflage, but to communicate. Species with strongly contrasting hues between ears and face tended to be fierce, and they suggest pandas may also use their ears to signal warnings to predators. The eye patches may help them recognize one another. Other studies have shown that pandas remember these patches, which vary greatly in size and shape. They can also enlarge them when staring at a competitor. As lovable as we may find those patches, pandas don’t: They cover their eyes with their paws when they don’t want to look aggressive.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.aal0840\nMore from ScienceShots\nPlease note that, in an effort to combat spam, comments with hyperlinks will not be published.\n')[0m

ANNOUNCES RETURN OF PHILADELPHIA CHINESE LANTERN FESTIVAL IN FRANKLIN SQUARE\n \nTweet this: Philadelphia Chinese Lantern Festival returns to @FranklinSqr this spring with all new lanterns  bit.ly/PCLFinfo  \n \nPHILADELPHIA, February 28, 2017 – Historic Philadelphia, Inc. announces the return of the blockbuster Philadelphia Chinese Lantern Festival in Franklin Square which will take place from May 9 to June 11, 2017 with all new creations. The first Philadelphia Chinese Lantern Festival in Franklin Square debuted in April 2016 and ran for seven weeks, welcoming 92,000 visitors from all 50 states and 10 foreign countries. The Festival is a celebration of light and culture that features artisans from China creating magnificent steel-framed and silk-wrapped giant animals, springtime flowers and trees, and symbols of Chinese culture using traditional Chinese methods. For five weeks, Franklin Square will glow with 29 larger-than-life illuminated lantern displays of 1,500 individual sculptures with more than 15,000 LED lights in brilliant colors. The giant fan favorite Chinese Dragon (newly rebuilt), but all of the other displays will be new for the 2017 Festival. In addition to the gorgeous light installations, festival-goers will witness authentic cultural performances that are all new for 2017 such as acrobats and folk dancers. Visitors can taste Asian cuisine and American favorites, drink a toast at the Dragon Beer Garden, and shop for artists’ creations crafted on site. Guests will still be able to play Philly Mini Golf, ride the Parx Liberty Carousel, and enjoy Center City’s best play place. The proceeds that Historic Philadelphia receive from the Festival will go into the operation and management of Franklin Square and its many free events all year long. \n \nAmy Needle, President and CEO of Historic Philadelphia, Inc. said, \'In 2016, Historic Philadelphia, Inc. could have never imagined that despite a rainy few weeks, 92,000 people from all walks of life came to experience the magic of the Philadelphia Chinese Lantern Festival in Franklin Square. We are looking forward to displaying all new creations in the Square this spring, and to embracing the historical and cultural immersion this brings to our region.\'\n \nJohn Chin, Executive Director of the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation, emphasized, \'During the 2016 Philadelphia Chinese Lantern Festival in Franklin Square, there was an uptick in Chinatown area restaurants and businesses that the community appreciated. For this coming season, the neighborhood businesses will be developing a series of promotions to complement the Festival and increase visitation to our unique corner of the city. Everyone in the area is thrilled to see the return of this Chinese cultural phenomenon.\'\n \nPhiladelphia City Councilman Mark Squilla stated, \'I am excited about the return of the Philadelphia Chinese Lantern Festival in Franklin Square. The money received by Historic Philadelphia, Inc. for the Festival is reinvested in the park for year-round beautification and maintenance. This project has created a successful public-private partnership and I am looking forward to seeing the new creations at the Festival this spring.\'\n \nBackground on Chinese Lantern Festivals\nOne city in China, Zigong in Sichuan province, has been the capital of Chinese lantern-making for thousands of years. The skills of the artisans are passed from one generation to the next. Twenty Chinese artisans will be in Philadelphia for an entire month, assembling and decorating the lanterns. Traditionally, the Lantern Festival is a Chinese festival celebrated on the fifteenth day of the first month in the lunar calendar marking the last day of the lunar New Year celebration dating back nearly 2000 years. In ancient times, the lanterns were fairly simple, and only the emperor and noblemen had large ornate ones. In modern times, lanterns have been embellished with many complex designs such as the ones on view at the Philadelphia Chinese Lantern Festival. The lanterns are begun with steel frames welded into outlined shapes, and then plain silk is wrapped and glued around each frame. Then, each lantern’s silk is hand-painted to create animals, flowers, patterns, and other designs to create each finished piece. Finally hundreds of LED lights are strung inside the lantern so that the silk glows in the dark. Each larger than life lantern will once again wow visitors with their amazing craftsmanship, cultural significance, and artistic beauty. \n \nMost of the lantern materials for the Philadelphia Chinese Lantern Festival in Franklin Square will be created in China especially for this event and sent via ten containers on a ship to the United States. The lanterns will be assembled by a 20-person team of artisans over a one-month period in the Square. The public is invited to view the process and progress on select days in April for free. The glowing yellow Chinese Dragon lantern is longer than three school buses and weighs 3,000 pounds. Standing 200 feet long and 21 feet high, the head will be installed by a crane with a 15-person crew. The lanterns will be placed all around the seven-and-a-half acre Square, and guests will walk among the displays each of which contain hundreds of LED lights.\n \nStudent Contest\nNew for 2017, Historic Philadelphia will conduct the Chinese Lantern Festival Student Design Contest giving area youth the opportunity to design a lantern that will be created in 3-D for this year’s Festival. Children 12 and under can submit a drawing of one of three Chinese zodiac animals: Year of the Monkey (2016), Rooster (2017) or Dog (2018). Between March 1 and March 31, students can submit a drawing and the artisans will create a giant lantern of their design. The lantern will be displayed throughout the Festival and the winner will get to take the sculpture home with them after it concludes. Rules and more information are at historicphiladelphia.org.\n \nSpecially-themed nights and Panda Promotion discounts at restaurants in adjacent Chinatown will be additions this year. Historic Philadelphia will also host special evenings to welcome community and neighborhood groups throughout the Festival. A calendar of special nights will be announced later this spring. Franklin Square will be open and free during regular daytime hours, and the Franklin Square Playgrounds will be open and free both daytime and evening hours, accessible through their own entrance for the duration of the Festival. After 6 pm, the Festival requires tickets for entry. Tickets are\n \n$17 for adults, $15 for seniors and military, and $12 for youth (3-17 years old). Children 2 and under are free. Tickets are available at the Festival entrance or online at  historicphiladelphia.org . Advance online tickets are highly recommended to avoid lines. For groups of 20 or more, please contact Group Sales by calling (215) 629-4026 x209. The Franklin Square Pavilion can be rented for birthday parties, corporate events, and special events. For information on booking a special event or party in the Pavilion:  http://historicphiladelphia.org/franklin-square/parties-and-facility-rentals/ .\n \nIn 2017, Historic Philadelphia will once again produce many free events including Egg Hunt, July 4th, & Labor Day celebrations, Franklin Square Birthday Celebration, Summer Movie Series, Pumpkin Patch and Trick-or-Treat Trail events, other special celebrations, and the six-week Franklin Square Holiday Festival and Electrical Spectacle Holiday Light Show. Franklin Square is operated and managed by the non-profit Historic Philadelphia, Inc. and receives no funding from the City of Philadelphia for its upkeep.\n \nThe Philadelphia Chinese Lantern Festival in Franklin Square is produced by the Tianyu Arts & Culture, Inc. and its parent company, Sichuan Tianyu Cultural Communications, Ltd. in cooperation with Historic Philadelphia, Inc.

Play Along. Learn through trial and error. Stay on the learning curve. Perhaps then, you’ll be able to differentiate what works and what doesn’t.\nHowever, if you want a shortcut, check out these 5 tried and tested tips, which ensure that Google robots play along, no matter what.\n1. Build buyer personas, then nail them with your Naturaltongue\nNaturaltongue?\nUmm… folks, if there could be Parseltongue, why not Naturaltongue, huh?\nParseltongue for snakes. Naturaltongue for Google RankBrain AI. Simple.\nBut then, what’s this Buyer Persona?\nAh, yes! That calls for some explanation!\nAccording to the Content Marketing Insitute , content marketer’s build buyer persona’s by picturising their actual customers in terms of their age, job title, the company they are working for, the challenges and frustrations they are facing every single day, in addition to whether or not they are an authority decision maker.\nOnce you have a clearer picture on who your actual audience is, start communicating with them in your natural voice.\nBuilding a target audience, bearing in mind the buyer persona, helps businesses take the bull by the horns. Put simply, it helps address the problems of your target audience, more precisely. Makes sense… nah?\nTake, for instance, a site called wickedgoodies.com. The site has on display an amazing array of cake recipes, trade show tips, cake books on Amazon, video ebooks and so much more, all focussing on cakes, in addition to some great online marketing tips.\nLooking at the site, you’d realize the owner of this site knows their online visitors thoroughly – inside out, and has optimized their website accordingly.\nSo, when a customer, say someone called Suzanne, who runs a brick and mortar cake shop, is desperately looking for some tips to accelerate her online sales and Google’s ‘Tips to promote cake online,’ she immediately stumbles on Wicked Goodies.\nHow come, you may ask?\nIt’s partly because Google’s RankBrain immediately figures out what Suzanne really wants and the RankBrain application intelligence robots rightly interpret ‘online’ as ‘internet’, and ‘tips’ as ‘strategies,’ thus returning high-quality results for Suzanne’s long tail search query.\nRankBrain AI is programmed to give better search results for complex and long-tail searches.\nNow, Suzanne could build on this info to make sure that her brick and mortar business not only survives but gives a tough competition to its competitors.\nKey takeways\nBuild a buyer persona and narrow down your target audience by sticking to it.\nFind what’s troubling your target audience, and then address those pain points in your natural language.\nUse related keywords (mind you, not the exact keywords). This could include synonyms, and co-occurrence (more on this in a minute) while offering solutions.\nCome up with creative blogs that immediately grab your user’s attention\nDesign products and services that address customer requirements\n2. Refer to Google’s crawl error report to spot gaps\nAs it turns out, for your site to feature in top searches, Google robots need to crawl your site, first and foremost.\nBut then, there are a few things to consider to ensure that Google doesn’t miss your site, in the first place.\nFirst off, make sure you are using accurate status codes on your site.\nFor example, use 301 redirects, instead of 302 redirects. Why you may ask? Well, because a 302 redirect is not at all programmed to inform Google robots that a particular page has been moved.\nAlso, consult Google’s crawl error report. The report keeps you covered in terms of gaps in your code, which perhaps is preventing Google robots from crawling your website properly.\nPlus, you can also block certain pages from being crawled using robots.txt. As you know, every site has a crawl budget and blocking images that are not that important, which ensures you have some spare budget in hand for really important pages.\nKey takeaway:\nUse 301 redirects, instead of 302 redirects\n')[0m
