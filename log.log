         "68\nSHARES\nA cutting edge futuristic supercar as Saab’s comeback?\nSwedish automakers Saab have never had a proper supercar. Nowadays the company is far behind its rivals. Would a supercar make any difference? One must admit that this carmaker had some high quality and sporty models like 9-3 Viggen and Sonett but what could really bring them back on the scene with the world class automakers? It’s simple, a supercar, to be precise, one called AiroX . New Gray Design concept got us thinking because it shows AI (artificial intelligence) built into the car aside from jet-inspired, futuristic looks.\nHowever, we should take this with a grain of salt. Real chances of Saab making a supercar are really small. As the company is managed by the ‘ National Electric Vehicle Sweden ’ which puts all its focus on breathing life into the 9-3 electric model, there is not much space for a supercar project. In addition to that, the company stated in January this year that China’s ‘Panda New Energy’ ordered 15,000 electric vehicles which imply that the production of those should start at least before the end of 2017. Unfortunately, that leaves no room for a supercar, maybe it could be one of the future projects.\n68\nSHARES\n",

         "Status Update: 'April' the Giraffe Is Still Pregnant, Enjoys Yard Time With Kicking Calf\n20 to 30 million people across the globe have tuned in to watch a live stream of her late-stage pregnancy\nSTATUS CHECK: You Can See the Kicks in April's Belly! \n\nThe 15-year-old giraffe named \"April,\" who has captivated millions of people across the world as they watch a live stream in anxious anticipation of the birth of her fourth calf at an upstate New York zoo, is still pregnant and doing well.\nNY Zoo Giraffe Stream Banned for 'Nudity' Back After Outcry\nVeterinarians with the Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, outside Binghamton, said April is experiencing increased belly movement. The happy and healthy mother-to-be has also started to produce milk and shed a few droplets during a Saturday evening examination.\nThe spotted beauty gazed into the camera, wiggling her ears as she chewed her breakfast Sunday morning. The zoo said the giraffes will stay inside due to the extreme temperature drop and wet or frozen conditions.\n\"Rest assured, they receive extra enrichment and extra attention on days they do not venture out,\" the zoo said. \"A little extra bonding time!\"\nShe and her mate, 5-year-old Oliver, had to be separated from each other while they frolicked outside Saturday afternoon because he got aggressive and wanted to rough house. According to vets, bullish behavior is common for male giraffes during the final stages of pregnancy.\nUS-Born Panda Bao Bao Lands in China After Leaving DC Zoo\n\"He does not want to play house -- he wants to ROUGH house,\" the park wrote in a Facebook post Saturday morning. \"That is natural behavior as males take no part in rearing their young, nor have a need for a female once she is pregnant. Sad but true.\"\nViewers were concerned about the long-necked lovers' separation and questioned the vet's intentions until the zoo offered reassurance and told animal lovers to trust them.\nNot much changed as the day came to a close: April alternated between standing still, swinging her tail, drinking water and slowly circling her pen. At one point during the afternoon, the calf could be seen kicking around in her belly.\nApril's pregnancy was catapulted into global headlines earlier Thursday after YouTube briefly yanked the zoo's live stream following complaints by animal activists that it violated the site's policies concerning \"nudity and sexual content.\" Thousands upon thousands of commenters voiced their frustration on Facebook and YouTube, and the stream was restored within an hour or so.\nAn Egg Has Landed!

The Toronto Zoo says attendance is up for the first time in several years, which it attributes to a baby animal boom and good weather. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young\nTORONTO — The Toronto Zoo is citing a baby animal boom as one of the main reasons for its first attendance increase in several years.\nIn an annual review presented to its board, the city-owned facility said more than 1.3 million people visited the zoo in 2016, an increase of nearly 170,000 people compared to those who came to the zoo the previous year.\n\"It was a very good year,\" said zoo spokeswoman Jennifer Tracey.\nAttendance had been declining at the zoo since 2013, when the facility had seen a boost due to the arrival of two pandas from China.\nFor 2016, the zoo cited several cubs — two pandas, four white lions and a polar bear — along with a rhinoceros calf as among main reasons for its attendance bump.\nThe new panda cubs, named Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue, even drew Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other politicians for a cuddle session at the zoo last spring.\nAccording to results of the zoo's 2016 on-site visitor survey, 37.7 per cent of respondents said they visited the facility because of the panda exhibit, 31 per cent said they went explicitly to see the panda cubs and a further 17 per cent said baby animals in general drew them there. The remaining respondents said they visited the zoo for other attractions.\nBabies weren't the only reason for the boost in attendance.\n\"The weather is also a huge factor,\" Tracey said. \"We had great fall weather.\"\nThe zoo had its third-highest October attendance since it opened in 1974 when 93,145 people visited, according to the report. And the following month was its best November on record when 46,638 came out.\nTracey said a hot, dry summer also had an impact.\n\"Rain, or even the threat of rain will make people change their plans for the day,\" she said.\nAs it plans for the year ahead, the zoo noted that many of its popular baby animals are leaving the facility after growing up.\nThe panda cubs, as well as the adult pandas, are scheduled to leave for the Calgary Zoo in March 2018, the white lion cubs have already left for a park in Quebec and Juno, the now-large polar bear, just left for Winnipeg's Assiniboine Park on Wednesday, Tracey said.\nSo the zoo is looking at the possibility of more babies.\n\"I am hopeful that there will be success with conservation breeding programs this year,\" Tracey said.\nShe also touted the upcoming opening of its \"Wildlife Health Centre\" that is scheduled to open some time this spring.\n\"There will be a public viewing area into some of the labs where they can see our reproductive technologists at work, x-rays, surgical suites and where they run a lot of the lab work,\" Tracey said.\nThe 2016 attendance boost led to increased revenues at the zoo, Tracey said, but the facility still needed a City of Toronto subsidy to balance the books.\nBy Liam Casey, The Canadian Press\n",

The delegation was more Singapore's show of backing down after the recent issues with China, where some of our Ministers started slamming China's foreign policy, and China retaliated by their show of strength. These young ministers probably sent there to be taught who is the boss in this region, if by any chance they start to forget and think they can have their own way with other countries like how they have they own way with their own citizens.\nAnyways, this is a working trip for the ministers. Now, when someone goes on working trips, they better bring back some good business. So, this is the same for the Ministers. Don't just go there for holiday, better bring back China investments to Singapore. Just like what Malaysia and Philippine leaders achieved when they visited China. Your pay are many times higher than theirs.

They include scenes of rare and extreme behaviours such as a humback whale blowing bubbles to defend a calf from shark attack and a goose chick’s death defying 400ft cliff jump.\nA strong Scottish strand will run through every aspect of the festival.  Among the guest speakers will be Nigel Pope, founder of Glasgow-based Maramedia, one of the UK’s leading wildlife filmmakers. There will be screenings of their work including episodes from Highlands and the Panda Award winning Hebrides which was narrated by Ewan McGregor.\nTo volunteer you simply need to be over 18 and willing to give a minimum of 12 hours to cover some of the following duties: stewarding at venues, welcoming and providing information to visitors, acting as runners to aid communication between venues, support of the general organisation, evaluation and operation of the festival.\nTo show they are part of the official WFFS team, volunteers will be given a WFFS hoodie.\nFor more information about the festival, and to volunteer, visit www.wildfilmfestivalscotland.co.uk/volunteers , closing date for applications is Sunday, March 5.\n",

         "Patricia Escarcega\nChino Bandido and Chop and Wok Serve Nontraditional Asian Fare — With Mixed Results\nThursday, March 2, 2017 at 7 a.m.\nBy Patricia Escarcega\nEXPAND\nA combo meal at Chino Bandido can include elements of a number of global cuisines.\nJackie Mercandetti\nDoes Chino Bandido have the weirdest menu in town? Possibly. It's hard to think of another local restaurant where you can order an egg foo yung burrito, pair a chile relleno with your pork fried rice, or get a rice bowl topped with both Sonoran machaca and Chinese barbecue.\nThe Mex-Chinese (with a dash of Caribbean flavor) restaurant debuted in 1990 in north Phoenix, a sort of forerunner to the kind of modern fusion cooking you now find at places like SumoMaya or the Clever Koi. Chino Bandido doesn't so much fuse distinct cuisines together, though - more like plops them side-by-side in the same aluminum bowl.\nThe restaurant has been around long enough to achieve cult-classic status in metro Phoenix. It's the restaurant equivalent of that quirky indie movie you love fiercely and remember fondly, but which might not be recommended for a mass audience, or perhaps doesn't have the same impact on a second viewing.\nStill, there is something eternal about eating at Chino Bandido, a feeling that's kind of evoked in the restaurant's tagline - \"Eat at Chinos, Live Forever!\"\nThe restaurant's mascot, a panda bear with a Pancho Villa-inspired canana (cartridge belt) slung across its chest, wearing a big sombrero and holding chopsticks, seems so curiously retro and cheesy, it feels about ready to be embraced as a local icon. You can picture the logo splashed across the front of some Phoenix hipster's faded vintage-style T-shirt.\nThe veggie quesadilla at Chino Bandido was decidedly underwhelming.\nJackie Mercandetti\nThe strip-mall restaurant itself is shabby yet appealing. The restaurant's lobby, decked out with black-and-white checkered floors and a \"Wall of Chino\" covered in plaques and award certificates bearing dates from nearly 20 years ago, seems untouched by time. You get the feeling that some of the friendly people working the counter have been there about that long, too.\nIf you grew up in north Phoenix, the bare-bones dining room, which has been expanded over the years to seat more than 100 guests on workaday folding tables, probably holds as many memories as any scrapbook.\nFor first-timers, the Chino Bandido menu - printed on long, white order forms with instructions and checkboxes - might seem about as complicated and indecipherable as somebody's medical chart. It's full of obscure acronyms - the JFR stands for jerk fried rice - and painfully obvious menu descriptions: Quesadillas, in case you haven't figured it out yet, are \"folded cheese crisps.\"\nOne of the best things about eating at Chino Bandido is simply figuring out the ordering system. The combos and configurations are almost endless, and you can get as weird with your order as you wish. You can order some Mexican-style carnitas, served over Jamaican jerk fried rice, with a cheese quesadilla on the side. Nobody will bat an eye.\nYou probably love the food at Chino Bandido's more than I do. On a recent visit, my combo bowl was a cheese-laden muddle of bland refried beans, under-seasoned pork fried rice, and an egg foo yung that was so devoid of flavor, it might have doubled as a waterlogged dishrag.\nAn order of the T.J. Veggie quesadilla was not much more than a soggy flour tortilla, half-heartedly sprinkled with a little cheese and crammed with cold iceberg lettuce and veggies.\nThe real allure comes with the proteins, unapologetically made in the vein of American Chinese fast food - things like the Jade Red chicken, Chinese barbecue pork, or Hengrenade chicken. You can sample the various meats before locking in your order at the counter.\nOne of the best items at Chino Bandido is the complimentary snickerdoodle cookie.\nJackie Mercandetti\nOn a recent visit, the Jade Red chicken yielded soft, fleshy bundles of meat, draped in a goopy, sodium-rich sauce. The Chinese barbecue pork had a sort of earthy richness, like a loose, vaguely sweet mole sauce.\nThe chewy texture of the meat, though, and the unnaturally goopy flavorings, may siphon away some of the joy of eating at Chino Bandido.\nThe most perfect thing I've ever eaten at Chino Bandido, as it happens, is not something smothered in an orange-reddish sauce. It's the complimentary house snickerdoodle cookie that comes with your meal. It's a light, sugary confection that seems like an odd way to wind down dinner, until you remember that you are at Chino Bandido, where anything goes.\nIf Chino Bandido doesn't satisfy your yen for Chinese takeout, another unusual spot for old-school American Chinese food is Chop and Wok, a fraying-around-the-edges, rock 'n' roll-themed haunt near Shea Boulevard and Scottsdale Road.\nEXPAND\nThe potstickers at Chop and Wok.\n",

         "NetEase Games Conducts Its First Ever Developers Forum in the West\n2017-03-02 03:10\nGUANGZHOU, China and SAN FRANCISCO, Mar. 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- NetEase Games today held its first ever developers forum in the West, titled \"Insight of Fun\", in San Francisco . Living up to the company's motto of \"good games have no borders\", lead developers of NetEase's five flagship games shared development concepts and behind-the-scene stories with an audience of gamers, industry peers, and reporters. The successful event was a direct reflection of the popularity and traction that NetEase Games has in overseas markets.\nThe Insight of Fun forum focused on NetEase Games' core value - committed pursuit of the highest quality games and player experience. The company's mission is for gamers, developers and others who are involved in the gaming ecosystem to explore and enjoy the fun of games. Going forward, NetEase Games will host regular events in overseas markets to share development experience with industry peers and to explore the globalized future of gaming.\n\"Quality games have no borders. At NetEase, it is our sincere hope to create more high quality and innovative products for gamers around the world,\" said Ethan Wang , V ice President of NetEase, Inc.\nAttendees also got a preview of NetEase Games' global product plan. \"This Spring, we will be launching a deep and immersive 3D-action MMORPG,\" said Riten Huang , General Manager of NetEase Games. \"Following that, we are excited to bring the popular game, Onmyoji, to audiences in the West. Later in 2017, we also plan to launch a strategy and exploration MMO game created by an international team of developers, including top industry talent s from China , the United States , Germany and South Korea .\"\nRobust financial and operational performance in China forms a solid foundation for NetEase's overseas expansion. In 2016, revenues of NetEase's online gaming segment reached $4 billion , up 61.6% year over year. NetEase Games continues to maintain high growth rate and deliver new hit games. After consolidating its market leadership in China , NetEase Games is looking to expand further overseas. When discussing the overseas strategy for NetEase Games, NetEase CEO Ding Lei mentioned that he has ambitious goals to achieve greater results in the non-Chinese gaming markets within the next three to five years.\nTo show their dedication toward overseas markets, NetEase sent its dream team of lead developers for five flagship games to the event. This group consisted of Chen Junxiong of the mobile version of the NetEase classic Fantasy Westward Journey, Jin Tao of 2016 blockbuster Onmyoji, Yu Kai of the company's first virtual reality game Twilight Pioneers, Liu Xi of the mobile game adaptation of Hollywood animation film Kung Fu Panda 3, and Wang Xi of the upcoming 3D warfare MMO War Rage.\nThese five developers represent NetEase Games' flagship titles and the highest quality of production that the company intends to bring to overseas markets. Early indications of global expansion have been very encouraging - Fantasy Westward Journey has over 100 million registered players worldwide; Twilight Pioneers was selected as among the first wave of releases on Google's virtual reality platform Daydream; Kung Fu Panda 3 was rated Google Play 2016 Top 10 Games in Korea; the Japanese version of Onmyoji was released last week and was number on the free download rankings. Unlike the others, however, War Rage was designed for overseas markets from the ground up.\nBy harnessing its industry leading game development capabilities and unique insight into fun, NetEase will propel its global expansion by introducing Chinese games to global markets, working with partners to publish titles in China , and create games developed from the ground up tailored to international audiences. Many exciting changes are ahead, but what remains is the company's commitment to creating the best games for players in China and around the world.\nAbout NetEase\nNetEase, Inc . i s a leading internet technology company in China .

         "What you need to know about the Arnold Sports Festival\nThursday\nMar 2, 2017 at 5:37 AM Mar 2, 2017 at 11:38 AM\nAlissa Widman Neese The Columbus Dispatch   @AlissaWidman\nGet pumped. The Arnold Sports Festival and Fitness Expo kicks off today.\nAn estimated 200,000 fitness enthusiasts, athletes, sports fans and spectators are expected to flock Downtown to the annual event named after one of the world's best-known bodybuilders, Arnold Schwarzenegger. \nHere are eight things you need to know to get ready for the big weekend:\n 1. What is it?\nThe Arnold Sports Festival is the largest multi-sport festival in the nation — even bigger than the Olympics — with about 20,000 athletes from 80 nations competing in 70 sports and events. The Expo will feature more than 1,000 booths of the latest in sports equipment, apparel and nutrition among competition stages. Most events are Friday-Sunday at the Greater Columbus Convention Center and the Ohio Expo Center.\n2. When did it start?\nSchwarzenegger and sports promoter Jim Lorimer have co-produced the U.S. festival in Columbus since 1989, when it debuted as a one-day bodybuilding competition known as the Arnold Classic. They now host multi-sport festivals on five other continents: Australia, South America, Africa, Asia and Europe.\n3. How much does it cost?\nA daily Expo ticket is $15 in advance and $20 at the door, which offers admission into the Arnold Fitness Expo and most other events. A three-day ticket is $40 in advance. Children 14 and under are free with an adult. Buy tickets and admission to other special events at ticketmaster.com/arnold.\n4. How do I get there?\nFree shuttles will connect every Downtown hotel to the Greater Columbus Convention Center for most of the weekend. A shuttle from there heads to the Ohio Expo Center. (View a shuttle map and schedule.) The Columbus Commons parking garages should have spaces available and guests can reserve other parking spots online ahead of time through Parking Panda.\n5. What's new?\nNew events in 2017 include lacrosse, disabled power-lifting, yoga classes and competitions, handball, the Arnold Pro Strongwoman, Indoor Scottish Highland Games and the Arnold Transformation Challenge. That's in addition to the iconic bodybuilding competitions and sporting events and everything in-between.\n6. Is it kid-friendly?\nChildren are encouraged to come to the Ohio Expo Center's Bricker Building for the Arnold Sports World Kids & Teens Expo on Saturday and Sunday. It's a smorgasbord of interactive sport demonstrations and activities with more than 200 vendors, zip-lining and a stage with nonstop entertainment.\n7. Will Arnold be there?\nOf course! Though it's possible to spot Schwarzenegger maneuvering through throngs of people throughout the weekend (just look for the swarming fans) he'll make some public appearances to present awards and take photos, too. His Sunday showcase from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Batelle Grand is the only opportunity to engage with him in an open forum. Tickets cost $25.\n8. Where can I learn more?\nCheck Dispatch.com all weekend for coverage of competitions, athlete profiles and feature stories about new events. Visit arnoldsportsfestival.com and follow the Arnold on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n",

(Oct. 13) \n\nAttendance had been declining since 2013, when the zoo had seen a boost due to the arrival of two pandas from China.\nTracey says a warm fall, a dry summer and a moderate spring also helped the numbers for 2016.\nShe says the attendance bump led to increased revenues\n",

If aquatic ecosystems are given a chance to rebound, they often will, as long as the numbers of fish have not been depleted too far. duration 28:55 SRND51 TVY (Secondary audio: DVI)\n12:30 am\nDaniel Tiger's Neighborhood [#203] Time for Daniel/There's Time for Daniel and Baby Too Time for Daniel Daniel is playing adventure tiger at home with Dad, but things are not quite the same, now that Baby Margaret is around.

         "Top Casinos\nBig Live Blackjack Win at Royal Panda Casino\nMar 2, 2017\nWritten by: Akos\nPin It \n\nRoyal Panda Casino player, Michael, has accumulated a big live blackjack win while playing at one of the exclusive high roller tables.\nRoyal Panda Casino appears to be one of the luckiest online gambling sites, especially for table game players. Last month, a roulette player from the UK had a €565,034 a winning streak at the Roulette Professional Series table. Before him, Royal Panda Casino announced the big live blackjack win of 30-year-old Michael from the Netherlands.\nMichael was playing at the Exclusive Royal Panda Live Blackjack VIP table, betting up to €5,000 per one hand. Such high bets insist that Michael is a high roller who’s confident in his blackjack strategy. Following a streak of big winning hands, Michael left the table with €71,250. What’s more, he also collected plenty of Royal Panda Casino loyalty points.\nThe popular UK gambling site has a slightly different loyalty reward-system than most casinos. The points you collect can be exchanged for bonuses as well as gifts such as gadgets, including iPad, iPhones, and MacBooks. A €50 bet on live blackjack translates to 1 loyalty point, so Michael probably finished his session with hundreds of loyalty points.\nScore the next big live blackjack win\nIf you’d like to score a similarly big live blackjack win, take a seat at one of Royal Panda Casino’s live blackjack tables. There are two exclusive ones, Live Blackjack VIP and Live Blackjack. Furthermore, there are two classic titles, Blackjack Classic and Blackjack Party.

         "Two Panda Cubs Take First Trip Outside their Vienna Zoo Compound 1:12\nTwin panda cubs Fu Feng and Fu Ban went on their first walk outside of their indoor enclosure at Vienna's Schoenbrunn Zoo on Tuesday and made their first appearance to the adoring public. The young pandas are almost seven months old, but despite their impressive climbing skills, the twin cubs were not allowed out into the open until now. A large number of journalists and visitors greeted the animals on their outing, making sure that their first adventure outside would be memorable. Their mother Yang Yang watched on closely as her cubs attempted to climb to the highest points of the outdoor enclosure. After the three-hour walkabout, the zoo keepers picked Fu Feng and Fu Ban up and brought them back inside their compound. The baby pandas will get some much needed rest before exploring their compound once more.\nMarch 3rd 2017\n2 hours ago\n/video/video.news.com.au/News/\nVideo\n",

         "Odisha Sun Times Bureau\n\nBhubaneswar, Mar 2:\nYet another Ollywood actor landed up in trouble as Odisha police arrested an actor on charges of defaming and intimidating a girl on social networking site.\nKharavel Nagar police arrested actor Anupam Panda and forwarded to court here today based on the complaint filed by the girl.\nAccording to reports, Anupam befriended the girl on a social networking site in 2014 after which a relationship developed between the duo. However, the girl decided to move out the relationship after coming to know that the actor was married. While Anupam reportedly assured the complainant to marry her after divorcing his wife, the latter was in no mood to mend the ties and go ahead with it.\nFollowing the breakup, the duped girl then distanced herself from Panda which he couldn’t take it. Enraged over this, he allegedly circulated their intimate photographs on social networking site and sent it to her family members. Besides, he also allegedly intimidated her.\nFollowing this, the girl studying MBA in a city-based institution filed a complaint with the local police station here leading to his arrest.\nNotably, Anupam Panda had played the lead character in ‘Flashback’ released in December 2015.\nThe regional entertainment industry has been embroiled in various controversies including casting couch and involvement in chit fund scam.\n",

The Toronto Zoo says attendance is up for the first time in several years, which it attributes to a baby animal boom and good weather. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young\nTORONTO — The Toronto Zoo says attendance is up for the first time in several years, which it attributes to a baby animal boom and good weather.\nThe park says more than 1.3 million people visited the zoo in 2016, an increase of nearly 170,000 people compared to those who came to the zoo the previous year.\nZoo spokeswoman Jennifer Tracey says the births of two pandas, four white lion cubs and a rhinoceros calf are the main reasons for the attendance bump.\nAttendance had been declining since 2013, when the zoo had seen a boost due to the arrival of two pandas from China.\nTracey says a warm fall, a dry summer and a moderate spring also helped the numbers for 2016.\nShe says the attendance bump led to increased revenues.\nBy The Canadian Press\n",

         "Netflix goes offline with its new feature that allows members to download their favorite TV series and movies to their devices. Televisione Streaming / Flickr\nWhat is your style of winding down after a particularly difficult day at work? Some of us might choose to head down to the local watering hole and have a pint or two while exchanging banter with our mates. Others prefer to just sit down, kick back their shoes and relax on their favorite sofa while turning the TV on. There are so many things to watch on TV these days, where do you start? Well, we can tell you one thing -- you would not go too far wrong if you are a Netflix customer. March madness is coming your way, and in a good manner too -- there are new Netflix movies and TV shows to enjoy. Without much further ado, here are the details on what is in store for the month of March on Netflix.\n\nIron Fist and The Discovery\n The two heavyweights that will make u p the bulk of Netflix originals would be Iron Fist and The Discovery for the month of March. The maiden season of the Marvel series Iron Fist will make its debut this coming March 17, where it will be yet another Marvel character who have made the transition to the small screen such as Daredevil, Jessica Jones and Luke Cage . Expect The Defenders to arrive once the entire Iron Fist series is shown, as that would then bring together all of the superheroes into the same team -- a budget Avengers, if you will.\n\nAs for The Discovery, this happens to be a brand new Netflix original movie that will see Jason Segel, Rooney Mara and Robert Redford star. The Discovery is titled that way, as it will concentrate on the discovery (duh!) of an afterlife, which eventually translates to millions of suicides as well as dealing with the fallout that happens after that.\n\nThere are also other noteworthy original titles from Netflix that will arrive this month, including the first season of 13 Reasons Why, the second season of Love, the second season of Grace and Frankie, as well as the Amy Schumer comedy special that is aptly titled, Amy Schumer: The Leather Special.\n\nHere are the titles that are available since March 1, 2017:\n\nAngry Birds: Season 2 (2013)\n Blazing Saddles (1974)\n Chicago (2002)\n Deep Run (2015)\n Dirt Every Day: Season 1 (2013)\n Epic Drives: Season 2 (2015)\n Friday After Next (2002)\n Head 2 Head: Season 2 (2013)\n Hot Rod Unlimited: Season 1 (2013)\n Ignition: Season 1 (2013)\n Impossible Dreamers (2017)\n Jurassic Park (1993)\n Jurassic Park III (2001)\n Kate and Mim-Mim: Season 2 (2015)\n Know Your Enemy – Japan (1945)\n Kung Fu Panda (2008)\n Let There Be Light (1946)\n Memento (2000)\n Midnight in Paris (2011)\n Nacho Libre (2006)\n Nazi Concentration Camps (1945)\n Roadkill: Season 2 (2013)\n Rolling Stones: Crossfire Hurricane (2012)\n San Pietro (1945)\n Singing with angels (2016)\n Sustainable (2016)\n Slums of Beverly Hills (1998)\n The Craft (1996)\n This Is Spinal Tap (1984)\n Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny (2006)\n The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)\n The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress (1944)\n The Negro Soldier (1944)\n Thunderbolt (1947)\n Tunisian Victory (1944)\n\nMarch 3, 2017\n Greenleaf: Season 1 (2016)\n\nMarch 4, 2017\n Safe Haven (2013)\n\nMarch 5, 2017\n Señora Acero: Season 3 (2016)\n\nMarch 7, 2017\n Amy Schumer: The Leather Special-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\nMarch 8, 2017\n Hands of Stone (2016)\n The Waterboy (1998)\n\nMarch 9, 2017\n Thithi (2015)\n\nMarch 10, 2017\n Buddy Thunderstruck: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Burning Sands-NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n Love: Season 2-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n One More Time: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n The Boss' Daughter (2016)\n\nMarch 13, 2017\n Must Love Dogs (2005)\n Million Dollar Baby (2004)\n\nMarch 14, 2017\n Disney's Pete's Dragon (2016)\n Jim Norton: Mouthful of Shame-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\nMarch 15, 2017\n Disney's The BFG (2016)\n Notes on Blindness (2016)\n\nMarch 16, 2017\n Beau Sejour: Season 1 –NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Coraline (2009)\n\nMarch 17\n Deidra & Laney Rob a Train-NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n Julie's Greenroom: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Marvel's Iron Fist: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Naledi: A Baby Elephant's Tale (2016)\n Pandora-NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n Samurai Gourmet: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\nMarch 18, 2017\n Come and Find Me (2016)\n The Vampire Diaries: Season 8 (2016)\n\nMarch 20, 2017\n El Reemplazante: Season 1-2 (2012)\n\nMarch 21, 2017\n Ali & Nino (2016)\n Another Forever (2016)\n Evolution (2015)\n Fire at the Sea (Fuocoammare) (2016)\n\nMarch 23, 2017\n How to Get Away with Murder: Season 3 (2016)\n Welcome to New York (2015)\n\nMarch 24, 2017\n Bottersnikes & Gumbles: Season 2-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Déjà Vu (2006)\n Felipe Neto: My Life Makes No Sense-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Grace and Frankie: Season 3-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Ingobernable: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Spider (2007)\n The Square (2008)\n The Most Hated Woman in America-NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)\n\nMarch 25, 2017\n The Student Body (2017)\n USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage (2016)\n\nMarch 26, 2017\n The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004)\n\nMarch 27, 2017\n Better Call Saul: Season 2\n\nMarch 28, 2017\n Archer: Season 7 (2016)\n Jo Koy: Live from Seattle-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\nMarch 30, 2017\n Life in Pieces: Season 1 (2015)\n\nMarch 31, 2017\n 13 Reasons Why: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Bordertown: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Cooper Barrett's Guide to Surviving Life: Season 1 (2016)\n Dinotrux: Season 4-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n FirstBorn (2016)\n Five Came Back-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n GLOW: The Story of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (2012)\n Rosewood: Season 1\n The Carmichael Show: Season 1-2\n The Discovery-NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n Trailer Park Boys: Season 11-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\n",

         "news.com.au — Australia’s #1 news site\nVideo\nTwo Panda Cubs Take First Trip Outside their Vienna Zoo Compound 1:12\nTwin panda cubs Fu Feng and Fu Ban went on their first walk outside of their indoor enclosure at Vienna's Schoenbrunn Zoo on Tuesday and made their first appearance to the adoring public. The young pandas are almost seven months old, but despite their impressive climbing skills, the twin cubs were not allowed out into the open until now. A large number of journalists and visitors greeted the animals on their outing, making sure that their first adventure outside would be memorable. Their mother Yang Yang watched on closely as her cubs attempted to climb to the highest points of the outdoor enclosure. After the three-hour walkabout, the zoo keepers picked Fu Feng and Fu Ban up and brought them back inside their compound. The baby pandas will get some much needed rest before exploring their compound once more.\nMarch 3rd 2017\nan hour ago\n/video/video.news.com.au/News/\n",

         "Top hedge fund Python coder talks open source burnout\nby Sarah Butcher About an hour ago\nAre you killing yourself with your side projects on Github?\nhttp://news.efinancialcareers.com/us-en/274030/top-coder-hedge-fund/\nYou've finished the day job, time for the unpaid side project\nIf you're a Python coder who wants to work for a hedge fund and you don't know Wes McKinney, you might want to familiarize yourself with the name. McKinney started working for Two Sigma, the huge quant hedge fund with around $40bn under management, in August 2016. He's best known, however, in the world of open source programming.\nAn MIT math graduate, McKinney began his finance career at hedge fund AQR Capital Management in 2007. Three years later, he quit to do a PhD at Duke. Since then, he's been steeped in the world of Python data analytics tools, including Datapad, a visual analytics system he sold in 2014, and the open source Pandas Python data analysis library,  which is nine years old this April.\n\"Open source is the future of how a lot of our software will get built,\" said McKinney, speaking at a Newsweek conference on artificial intelligence and data science in London today. However, because open source software is typically developed by engineers working on unpaid side projects, he said many open source initiatives are unsustainable and can absorb all engineers' free time. Open source programmers, \"have lives and families,\" said McKinney, adding that he personally has started limiting his involvement for this reason. \"I personally feel that if my open source work isn't being sponsored, I ought to focus on things that can pay my rent.\"\nMcKinney didn't say so, but this might be why he joined Two Sigma, which pays an average of $417k to each of its staff in London.  Two Sigma, along with rival quant fund Man AHL, is one of the pioneers in the use of open source code in trading applications. \"The best way for finance to contribute to open source is to dedicate engineering time at the organization to allow open source projects to survive,\" McKinney said. This way, open source coders will get paid for their passion.\nFor this to happen, however, finance needs to open up. Ever-secretive, financial services firms have traditionally been mistrustful of the open-source communities where everything is shared by definition. This is changing, but only on the periphery. Gary Collier, co-chief technology officer at hedge fund Man AHL, said AHL doesn't use open source code for the proprietary algorithms in its trading systems, but for the \"building blocks\".  Airflow, a tool developed by Airbnb, is being trialled as a scheduling device by the fund, for example.\nAs hedge funds wake up to the importance of open source, involvement in communities like Github is a valuable source of CV points for potential recruits. \"If you want to recruit top talent into an organization, the organization needs to get into open source,\" says Collier. Equally, candidates need to show evidence of involvement in open source projects. \"If you're a techie, you need to be on Github,\" says another senior hedge fund technologist. \"It's like being an artist or an architect  you need your side projects, you need to point people towards your portfolio.\"\nThis is all well and good, except developing your open source portfolio takes time. And as McKinney points out, time is short when you've got a day job and family to consider. It's even worse if your open source project takes off. In this case, McKinney said you can become \"overburdened with success.\" For example, his Panda system  which has 9,000 stars on Github  reached a point where it required so much maintenance and stabilization time that he had little time for innovation or anything else. \"It becomes a full time job,\" said McKinney. \"Which is difficult when people are working on these things on a voluntary basis.\"\nRelated articles:\nHedge fund's top 24 year-old coder shares his secrets\n",

The Toronto Zoo says attendance is up for the first time in several years, which it attributes to a baby animal boom and good weather. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young\nTORONTO — The Toronto Zoo says attendance is up for the first time in several years, which it attributes to a baby animal boom and good weather.\nThe park says more than 1.3 million people visited the zoo in 2016, an increase of nearly 170,000 people compared to those who came to the zoo the previous year.\nZoo spokeswoman Jennifer Tracey says the births of two pandas, four white lion cubs and a rhinoceros calf are the main reasons for the attendance bump.\nAttendance had been declining since 2013, when the zoo had seen a boost due to the arrival of two pandas from China.\nTracey says a warm fall, a dry summer and a moderate spring also helped the numbers for 2016.\nShe says the attendance bump led to increased revenues.\nBy The Canadian Press\n",

         "What FY results mean for Nichols plc and Spirent Communications plc\nNichols. Fair use.\nKevin Godbold | Thursday, 2nd March, 2017 | More on: NICL SPT\nShares have been moving up lately in Spirent Communications (LSE: SPT) the provider of test methodologies and solutions for data communications and in Nichols (LSE: NICL) the soft drinks manufacturer. So, is there anything in today’s full-year results from these firms to halt the momentum or does progress look set to continue?\nAll looking good\nHeadline figures for Nichols include revenue up 7.4% compared to a year ago, an operating profit rise of 9% and adjusted earnings per share ticking 9.7% higher. That all looks good, but the best figure of all is the directors’ hiking of the full-year dividend by 15.3%. I think that move speaks volumes about the how they see the health of the business and its prospects.\nAfter reflecting on \"another very good year\", non-executive chairman John Nichols said he expects the firm’s clear strategy for growth to overcome challenging soft drinks markets during 2017. His confidence is underpinned by the company’s strong brands, diversification and successful track record of growth.\nThose all-important brands include names such as Vimto, Panda, Sunkist, Levi Roots and Feel Good Drinks. As well as diversity of brands, the firm has sales diversified across markets with Vimto, for example, selling in more than 85 countries. Meanwhile, its track record of growth speaks for itself.\nYear to December\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\nOperating cash flow per share (p)\n34.8\n",

         "NBH managing director hints that FX issue would be unfavourable - paper\n\n\nBudapest, February 16, 2017 (MTI-ECONEWS) - National Bank of Hungary managing director Daniel Palotai suggested Hungary would be better off financing its debt with forint, rather than FX, issues this year in an interview published in Thursday's issue of business daily Vilaggazdasag.\n\n\n\"Naturally, a decision on the financing structure [of Hungary's state debt] is the responsibility of the debt manager. We just wanted to call attention to the fact that if one looks not just at nominal interest rates, but at all costs involved [in FX issues] as well as exchange rate risks, forint financing is more advantageous at present than FX financing,\" Mr Palotai told the paper.\n\n\n\"The NBH does not want to have a say in debt management, rather it wants to support a reduction in the country's vulnerability,\" he added, noting steps the central bank has taken to boost demand for forint government securities.\n\n\n\"We can finance ourselves from internal sources and in forints. That's why we believe that a strategy built on the foundation of forint financing continues to be achievable, and more advantageous,\" he said, adding that the NBH also sees further opportunity to move in the direction of securities with longer maturities.\n\n\nMr Palotai said that the issue of a low-volume onshore \"panda\" yuan-bond would be \"favourable\" as it could \"support geographical diversification\" and \"serve economic diplomacy goals\".\n\n\nNational Economy Minister Mihaly Varga said late last year that the government plans FX issues of EUR 1.2bn in 2017, but the volume could vary depending on market possibilities. Hungary could tap euro, USD, yuan or yen bond markets, he added.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n        \nBack to the list\n\n\n",

         "Editions:\nFunk Fest 8 rocks into Punta Gorda\nBY BOB MASSEY\nbmassey@floridaweekly.com\nHere Come the Mummies rock it out at Funk Fest 7. ALEX ARATARI / FLORIDA WEEKLY\nBring on da noise! Bring on da funk! Bring on Punta Gorda's favorite festival to get down and shake, rattle and roll.\nYes, Funk Fest 8 makes its crashes into City Marketplace on March 3 and 4, featuring its eternal headliners - the macabre musicians whose identities remain under wraps, Here Come the Mummies, along with 14 other bands exciting enough to tighten the Sphinx's sphincter.\nIn 2016, Funk Fest evolved for the first time from a one- to two-day extravaganza, with stupendous results.\n\"Last year we had about 3,000 or 4,000 people,\" said Nick Nemec, who organizes the event along with his father, Matt Nemec. \"This year, we hope it's going to be larger than that. Primarily the people who come to this are from outside of the area, and we're pretty proud of that. But we created it for our locals, so we use Punta Gorda in the name.\"\nBig Sam's Funky Nation. COURTESY PHOTOS\nThe Nemecs - who own Big Crush Distribution - are not only the founders of Funk Fest, but also the Big Orange Music Fest that debuted in September. They seem to have a knack for establishing successful events, which apparently includes a willingness to change things up, as they'll be doing with this year's Funk Fest.\n\"The whole thing essentially is going to be different,\" Mr. Nemec said. \"The actual property itself - the way Funk Fest is set - is going to be turned around and moved all around. It's going to give us a lot more festival space than last year. It's going to definitely let everyone spread their wings a little bit and enjoy the property more.\"\nThis year, he promises to have more than 15 vendors in the \"indie\" market, which will have merchants offering a variety of goods from hammocks to tie-dyed clothing to jewelry. Added to the mix will be a professional glass-blower who will creating and selling pieces on site, and a speed painter who will not only offer small-canvas pictures but will also be working on a mural that will progress through the duration of the festival.\nBob White, Mummy Rah and Lori White.\nOther additions include: general admission seating that's 30 feet closer to the stage, a larger second stage, craft beers and boutique wines offered to both VIP and general admission ticketholders and a food truck village.\nIf putting together Funk Fest sounds like a lot of work, it is.\n\"Funk Fest 7 last year was March 4 and 5,\" Mr. Nemec said. \"I think we started on Funk Fest 8 on March 9 and 10. We gave ourselves a couple of days' reprieve, and then started hitting it up and trying to get the acts put together. It takes a full year to put together the event now.\"\nTim Reynolds & TR3\nAs with previous years, the musical acts will perform on two stages, trading off so that when one band finishes on one stage, the next band begins on another.\nThe reason band selection begins a year in advance is because, (1) there are 15 of them, and (2) attendees of past festivals make suggestions on other bands they'd like to hear. The Nemecs also target their own favorites that they feel are a good fit - including the perennial appearance of Here Come the Mummies.\n\"This year, we have the world-famous Neville family (Dumpstaphunk, led by Ivan Neville, son of singer Aaron Neville) headlining on Saturday,\" Mr. Nemec said. \"We have Jim Reynolds, the lead guitarist for the Dave Matthews Band. They're going to be headlining on Friday night. Then there's Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad, which is No. 1 on the Billboard chart for reggae. The list goes on. It's pretty incredible the lineup this year.\"\nGiant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad\nThe Motet, from Colorado, is the biggest festival band right now on the circuit, he added.\n\"The Motet is really one of the sleeper bands that people around here might not know, but they're really well known on the West Coast of the United States. They're going to be a band that will leave your mouth wide open, and you're going to want more. They are high energy, high octane, with amazing musicianship.\"\nThe only tickets left to Funk Fest 8 are general admissions seats. The \"exclusive\" weekend pass tickets - selling at a whopping $1,500 a pop - sold out two months ago. The $130 \"premier\" were nearly gone before the end of February. And it would surprise no one if this year's crowds exceed 4,000. Why not?\n\"This is an all-day, all-weekend music festival that never stops,\" Mr. Nemec said. \"The music is going to be world class, mostly in the funk genre but also a lot of jazz and rock and even some country infusion. It's a little bit for everybody. I don't think anyone would come and say they didn't like the music.\n\"And it's not just music - it's art. It's a lifestyle. It's great cocktails, craft beers, food. It's going to encompass a lot of cool things.\" ¦\n>> What: Funk Fest 8\n>> When: 3:30 p.m. to midnight Friday, March 3;1:30 p.m. to midnight Saturday, March 4\n>> Where: Punta Gorda City Marketplace, across from River City Grill\n>> Cost: Advance tickets: $50 for both days, $25 for Friday only, $35 for Saturday only.\n>> Tickets and information: www.Funk- FestPuntaGorda.com\n\n\n\n",

In 27 years since the anticommunist revolution of 1989 the country has had at least 25 health ministers take office. Doctors, especially younger ones, are fleeing the country in search of better work conditions and career opportunities. The Romanian Health Ministry states there is a severe doctors shortage. While things may look a little better in the city, Romania's villages are plagued with a lack of access to healthcare. Family doctors are often overworked having to care for a larger number of patients than the recommended average. Ciupitu is living proof that, despite all the difficulties and the problems in a flawed system, there still are doctors who commit to their patients. She stands to help remember that being a doctor is a calling.\n© Asger Ladefoged\nWhat happens, when 28 schoolchildren meet the controversial Danish therapist Carl-Mar Møller and are encouraged to play freely without rules? A sixth grade class from Øster Farimagsgade, a School in Copenhagen has done it twice. They went from the posh part of central Copenhagen to muddy wildness in Kokkedal, Denmark. There is only one rule at Carl-Mar Møllers place: No shoes inside. So nobody interfered with the pillowfight in the dormitory. Everything was in play and all involved left the fight exhausted and smiling.\n© Frederik Buyckx\nThere is a peculiar transformation of nature when winter comes, when snow and ice start to dominate the landscape and when humans and animals have to deal with the extreme weather. The series investigates this struggle against disappearance. The struggle against a whiteout. These photos were made in the Balkans, Scandinavia and Central Asia; remote areas where people often live in isolation and in close contact with nature. A harsh existence, fighting against superhuman forces.\n© Dino Kuznik\nI found the parking lot at Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park Visitor Center way more interesting than the actual Monument Valley.\n© Yuan Peng\nThis series was taken in a sports school in Jining, in Shandong province, China. Liu Bingqing and Liu Yujie are twin sisters, who have liked gymnastics since their childhood. They have studied, trained and grown up here.\n© Eduard Korniyenko\nIn the Soviet era, the sport of bodybuilding was not welcomed by official institutions, as opposed to weight lifting, which was judged acceptable and included in the Olympic program. But people everywhere, from small towns in the far North-East to Siberia, Moscow and even the foot of the Caucasus Mountains, persisted in going to the \"sweat box\" gyms in cellars, to \"build a body.\" Western magazines crammed with images of unrealistically muscled male and female bodies passed from hand to hand and an additional impetus to this semi-legal sport came with the growth of Arnold Schwarzenegger's popularity. Today, with the ban lifted, bodybuilding’s popularity has not diminished. The only difference is that some of the clubs have moved from their old basements into modern fitness centres, although the basement scene remains. A couple of times a year the participants climb the podium during various amateur and even professional tournaments. Here you can meet anyone; tax inspectors and businessmen, housewives and popular TV presenters. Regardless of social status, or whether you live in a small town in the centre of Siberia, or in a big city, the only important thing for these people is making their bodies look perfect, and being admired by others.\n© Mahesh Shantaram\nAnywhere in the world, it takes a black person to tell us what racism really feels like. On January 31st, 2016, India woke up to yet another news of a shocking mob attack against a Tanzanian student. This particular one was appalling enough to earn international press and force the nation into a period of soul-searching. Since the incident, I've been traveling across the country to meet Africans and learn about their experiences. I make portraits as a personal response to give them recognition. Hamza came all the way from Nigeria to study human rights in India. This I found surprising. I didn't know one could study that subject here except perhaps to study its spectacular absence. Hamza is by far the most sensitive guy I've ever met on this tour of Africans in India. When I asked to photograph him in his wallpapered dwelling, he requested that he be joined by his love, Shukura, a student of nursing. He says of this relationship, \"Thank you for being patient with me. Together we can prove those bitches wrong.\"\n© Dario Mitidieri\nMarch 2017 will mark the sixth anniversary of the beginning of the war in Syria. More than 470,000 people have died since. In all, 11.5% of the country’s population have either been killed or injured. 45% of the population have been displaced, 6.36 million internally and 4.8 million abroad. This is the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era.  Lost Family Portraits aims to tell the story of those who have lost family members in the Syrian war, and who have made their way to the refugee camps in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. The empty chairs or spaces in the photographs symbolize the missing family members. Lost Families Portraits is a reminder of the of the destructive power that war has over families. It is also a testimony to the 1.5 million refugees who are left behind in Lebanon, who cannot afford to buy their way into Europe and who have nothing to go back to.\nOWAYED'S FAMILY - \"I was forced to leave my 4 sons behind.

During the renovation of the museum the equilibrium and the magic of the Museum changed: the animals and the objects gained a new and bizarre life.

It’s hard to imagine, but these animals, who roamed the earth for eight million years, were only discovered in the last century. Unknown, and hidden from the western world for millions of years, even today they are seen by few but known by most everyone. Found only in central China, the entire species came dangerously close to extinction. Scientists considered the giant panda a relic species; shy, and difficult to breed in captivity. But now there is a glimmer of hope, as years of research are finally paying off. In a region where bad environmental news is common, China cracked the code and is on its way to successfully saving its most famous ambassador. The giant panda was recently taken off the endangered species list!\nA cub gets weighed at Bifengxia.

It shows you what happens when you begin to look at the language surrounding food in a comedic way, therefore transforming what the names of the meals and foods are in to what they literally describe and making them come alive as a physical form. Above is Bangers and Mash.\n© Dongni\nA variety of urban form and minimalist architecture breaks the old structure, splitting it into triangles, squares and diamond shapes, refracting a new living style on extant spatial structures. Demonstrating a free use of the language of visual forms, it appears like a game, similar to Goldbach's conjecture; the destruction of the ossified template of the city, a visual exploration of breaking the rules. In a spatial context, when we ignore the aesthetics of the city, ignore the rules and celebrate the deconstruction and reconstruction of the urban space, the space itself gives us more control and adds more joy to the city.\n© Diego Mayon\nProstitution is legal in Greece and the authorities decided to stipulate that all brothels must have permits. There are different kind of brothels, the upper class ones are called Studio. The difference from the normal brothels are the buildings, more discreet, the attitude of the prostitutes, more polite, and the price, obviously higher.\nA person welcomes the clients and once inside there is a waiting room where the girls available come out to show themselves.

The adult webcam industry is worth $1 billion annually, and is growing fast as the technology becomes better and cheaper.  Collectively, the sites are estimated to be visited daily by some 5 percent of the web's global users and the number of models performing live online shows from private apartments or from specialized studios is increasing worldwide. Romania, a country with one of the highest rates of youth unemployment in the EU, is now the undisputed world capital of studio-based cam operations, thanks to widespread wireless broadband access. The industry has grown substantially since 2001, and most major Romanian cities now count hundreds of facilities offering English-speaking male and female models—most in their twenties—fast internet connections, high definition webcams and decorated rooms where they can turn into the virtual best friends and cybersex partners of paying clients, mostly from North America, but also from European and Asian countries. In exchange for the workspace, the studios take a percentage of the models’ pay—which can reach $48,000 per month. The models are paid by platforms like Luxembourg-based LiveJasmine, one of the leading providers, ranking as the 103rd most popular site in the world and, with 25 million unique visitors monthly, the 80th most visited site in the USA.\n© Tasneem Alsultan\n\"I married my dental college classmate. Sharing two children and a happy marriage, we finally decided to buy our dream house. Two days before signing the lease, he died in a motorcycle accident. Then, my father died. I was legally required to have a male guardian. I now wait for my son to turn 16 to take that role. Until then, my step brother decides on my behalf.\"\nWhilst Saudi Arabia is an international symbol of Islam, many Saudis would agree that there's a strong disconnect between the Qur'an and local traditions. I wanted to answer question that many shared: Do we need marriage to signify that we have love? Do you need a husband to have a significant life? I started the project thinking I only had my personal story to share. I was married at the age of 17, and living separately as a single parent for the last six years of an unhappy 10 year marriage. Many family members commented on how foolish I was to ask for a divorce. Only later, I realized that there were many Saudi women who had similar experiences, beyond my expectations of a typical Saudi housewife. With each story, I found more women sharing complex marriage theories and experiences. I followed the stories of widows, happily married, and divorced women. I explored the concept of love, photographing my young daughter and grandmother. Utilizing imagery (with permission from those weddings I photographed) I interlaced the construction and expectation of marriage through often elaborate wedding ceremony imagery and rituals. A common realization with every woman I photographed, was that they all managed to overcome the many hurdles that was put by society or/ and state.\n© Li Song\nIn November 2016, Li Hang, an eleven-year-old boy from Harbin, arrived at Changchun weight loss centre determined to lose weight. He had been diagnosed with Prader-Willi Syndrome when he was 3 years old, and on admission, his weight had reached 155 kilograms. Prader-Willi Syndrome is a disease related to an abnormality in chromosome 15, and in around 70% of patients is inherited from their father. It occurs in 1 in 15000 people.  Li Hang was being treated with traditional Chinese medicine every day, including massage, acupuncture, fire treatment and cupping therapy. Fire treatment is a weight loss treatment. Ingredients are applied to the body’s meridian system, with the fire process unblocking meridian points that hinder the speed of the body’s metabolic processes, all with the aim of transforming fat into energy that can be eliminated from the body. From his initial fear to this point, Li Hang has been greatly tormented, but he is supported by his faith in doing what is necessary to live a normal person’s life and to look after his mother.\n© Amber Bracken\nOceti Sakowin, or the Seven Council Fires, is the true name of the great Sioux nation and refers to the coming together of the different factions of the tribe.  Oglala, Cheyenne, Ut, Cree, Hopi and non-indigenous all are among the 200+ tribes represented in the camps and on the front lines. The last time there was a similar gathering was before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, 1876. For nearly ten months, members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and their allies have been camped in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing their land and water. The estimated $3.78 bill project is nearly complete, crossing almost 1,172 miles. But the resistance has stalled development at the Missouri River. Although on it's face, the issue is the pipeline, the conflict runs much deeper and is steeped in generations of violent history. These are the people of the Battle of Little Big Horn and of Wounded Knee, who were driven to starvation by the loss of the buffalo and away from their sacred Black Hills. Police treatment of water protectors hasn't been out of step with this history. In military vehicles and body armor, police have indiscriminately used tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, percussion grenades and water canons in sub-zero temperature. Despite all of this, the pipeline is still unresolved and water protectors are still on the land. But wether the pipeline is completed or not, the groundswell created for this resistance will certainly have reverberations for industry and indigenous people alike.

Tens of thousands are sheltering in neighborhoods declared liberated by Iraqi forces and many more remain in parts of the city under ISIS control.

Many have already made the harrowing decision to flee their homes, in some cases leaving behind the bodies of loved ones who died as the fighting came to their area and had to be buried in front gardens.\n© Yulia Grigoryants\nLusine with her children in their tiny apartment in Gyumri, sleeping all 6 in the only room, that serves also as kitchen and playroom for the family. In 1988, a 7.0 Richter-scale earthquake struck northern Armenia. The quake killed at least 25,000 people in the region. Thousands more were maimed and hundreds of thousands left homeless. Gyumri, Armenia’s second largest city bore much of the damage. Large-scale war by the early 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union, an energy shortage, and a blockade that left landlocked Armenia with just two open borders contributed to exacerbating the region's already prevalent social and economic problems. A quarter of a century later, Gyumri has the country’s highest poverty rate at 47.7%. The city has lost nearly half of its population since 1988, due in part to the migration of the labor force. A few thousand families are still living in makeshift shelters, waiting for help. Many of them are not eligible for new housing, since they are not considered to be direct victims of the earthquake. 25 years later, they are still waiting for urgently needed improvements to their dwellings. During the Soviet era, these huge twin dormitory buildings on the outskirts of Gyumri accommodated around 60 families each. Today there are just four families living here, among decaying walls and corridors.\n© Sandra Hoyn\nKajol with her 6-month-old baby Mehedi and a customer on her bed. Two weeks after birth of Mehedi she was forced to have sex again with customers. Because of the baby her business is not good. The Kandapara brothel in the district of Tangail is the oldest and one of the largest in Bangladesh - it has existed for some 200 years. It was demolished in 2014 but has been re-established with the help of local NGOs. The brothel district is surrounded by a two-meter wall, and in the narrow streets within, there are food stalls, tea shops and street vendors. More than 700 sex workers live and work here with their children and their madams. Many of the women were either trafficked or born inside the brothel's walls and in this way their livelihood is secure. Their customers are policemen, politicians, farmers, fishermen, factory workers and groups of teenage boys.\n© Michael Tummings\nHidden captures man’s engagement with nature through a close examination of the practice of hunting. Hunting lies at the foundation of human survival. These unflinching photographs capture the human element in the ritualized killing of animals. Their focus is on authentic, observed moments that have been shaped by tradition, and which are still practiced in the modern world. Increasingly, our access to nature is designated as a cultural activity. Nature functions as construct of the imagination, where it is romanticized as pure and harmonious. But nature itself is marked by decay and violence. While hunting posits man as an external source of violence, the culling of animals maintains the balance and diversity of the landscape – even as it domesticates the landscape into an elaborate garden. These photographs reference the classic European tradition of paintings depicting the hunt, in addition to 20th century photographic portraiture. The rituals and divisions of class are inherent to the images in Hidden, as are both the modernization and preservation of tradition. Employing 5 x 4 analogue photography, the series uses a detached camera eye to observe the social dynamics of the group, its rituals, and the ways in which they are infused with meaning.\n© Nader Saadallah\nQuarries’ Men is a portfolio about white limestone quarries craft in Minya, Egypt and how are the workers can make and shape these Stone from the white mountain.

         "First timer's guide to the National Cherry Blossom Festival\n0\nShayla Martin\nFor the AJC\n10:30 a.m. Thursday, March 2, 2017 Atlanta Life\n0\nThe true sign that spring has sprung in Washington, D.C., is the bloom of thousands of cherry trees sprinkled across the National Mall . A gift from Japan in 1912, the 3,020 trees were planted around the Tidal Basin and East Potomac Park.\n» RELATED: 10 can't-miss spring festivals in metro Atlanta \n\nThe cascade of blooms inspired a three-week festival, drawing more than 1.5 million visitors to Washington each year. The 2017 National Cherry Blossom Festival takes place from March 15 until April 16, with peak bloom (the day when 70 percent of the trees around the Tidal Basin have opened their buds) predicted for March 14 to 17. The festival is filled with a variety of signature events, including Opening Ceremony on March 25 at Warner Theater, the Blossom Kite Festival on April 1 and the National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade on April 8.\n» RELATED: How to get tickets for the national African American history museum \n\nTrip tips\nA trip to the nation's capital for the National Cherry Blossom Festival is an item on many bucket lists, but navigating the city when it swells with fellow tourists can be overwhelming. Narrowing down what to pack, where to spot the blooms, where to stay and where to park is no small task.\nAlthough items like great walking shoes and a camera are a must, there are a few other things you'll want to toss in your suitcase. The pollen count surges during peak bloom, so bring Claritin or any other non-drowsy allergy medicine if you have pollen allergies, along with extra tissues and eye drops. Non-perishable snacks like trail mix and dried fruit are also good to have on hand since prices at food carts and stands along the National Mall go up during the festival.\nTo see the flowers and avoid major crowds, take a self-guided tour of the United States National Arboretum , home to 76 varieties of cherry trees. Cherry blooms are also found in Anacostia Park along the Anacostia River; the Japanese-style garden at Hillwood Estate, Museum & Gardens ; Rock Creek Park and Tudor Place in Georgetown.\n» RELATED: Wildly popular Yayoi Kusama ‘Infinity Mirrors' exhibit coming to Atlanta's High Museum \n\nWhere to stay\nCherry blossom fever takes over nearly every aspect of the city, reflected by special hotel packages and menu items at area restaurants and bars. Make memories at Capella Washington, D.C., Georgetown , where the Cherry Blossom Bloom package combines a full breakfast and accommodations in a superior room, with a private Segway tour through downtown and a professional photography session among cherry blooms. The hotel will bid farewell with your framed photography upon checkout. The Drink in the Blossoms Package at The Donovan gifts guests with two cocktails from hotel restaurant Zentan , two sachets of Organic Cherry Blossom Rose tea and a postcard featuring artwork inspired by the cherry blossoms from local artist Jamie Langhoff. Finally, families will love a stay at Avenue Suites Georgetown , where each suite has a fully-equipped kitchen, allowing guests to take advantage of the property's Stock The Fridge program with Trader Joe's. Not one to miss out on cherry blossom fun, the Your Avenue to the Cherry Blossoms package includes a personalized walking map of the Tidal Basin, guaranteed parking and a complimentary drink at the on-site A Bar lounge.\nGetting around\nFinding parking is notoriously difficult in Washington, so take the efficient and comprehensive Metrorail system. If your trip is three days or more, leave your car overnight in the daily parking lot at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and take the metro (located within the airport) to downtown. Metro Center, Federal Triangle, Smithsonian, Archives and L'Enfant Plaza stops all are within walking distance from the Tidal Basin cherry trees.\nIf driving is a must, there are free parking spaces on the National Mall along Madison and Jefferson Drives near the Smithsonian Museum, and a free parking lot at East Potomac Park, but spots fill quickly. Additionally, free on-street parking is available throughout downtown but generally restricted to two hours. Apps like SpotHero and Parking Panda , and BestParking.com allow users to find a parking space, compare rates and reserve a space at a discounted price. At all costs, avoid parking at a hotel, where rates are much higher than public lots, and office building garages.\nGetting there\nWashington, D.C., is serviced by three major area airports: Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA); Dulles International Airport (IAD); and Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Airport (BWI). DCA is the only airport directly connected to the Metrorail system via the yellow and blue lines, but IAD and BWI Airport are accessible via Metrobus and Metrorail. Various flight carriers offer nonstop flights to all three airports from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.\nFor more information on the National Cherry Blossom Festival, visit www.nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/ and for more information about Washington, D.C., visit washington.org/ .\nThis story has been updated to reflect the 2017 National Cherry Blossom Festival.

         "Editions:\nFunk Fest 8\n... rocks into Punta Gorda\nBY BOB MASSEY\nbmassey@floridaweekly.com\nHere Come the Mummies rock it out at Funk Fest 7. ALEX ARATARI / FLORIDA WEEKLY\nBring on da noise! Bring on da funk! Bring on Punta Gorda’s favorite festival to get down and shake, rattle and roll.\nYes, Funk Fest 8 makes its crashes into City Marketplace on March 3 and 4, featuring its eternal headliners — the macabre musicians whose identities remain under wraps, Here Come the Mummies, along with 14 other bands exciting enough to tighten the Sphinx’s sphincter.\nIn 2016, Funk Fest evolved for the first time from a one- to two-day extravaganza, with stupendous results.\n'Last year we had about 3,000 or 4,000 people,' said Nick Nemec, who organizes the event along with his father, Matt Nemec. 'This year, we hope it’s going to be larger than that. Primarily the people who come to this are from outside of the area, and we’re pretty proud of that. But we created it for our locals, so we use Punta Gorda in the name.'\nBig Sam's Funky Nation COURTESY PHOTOS\nThe Nemecs — who own Big Crush Distribution — are not only the founders of Funk Fest, but also the Big Orange Music Fest that debuted in September. They seem to have a knack for establishing successful events, which apparently includes a willingness to change things up, as they’ll be doing with this year’s Funk Fest.\n'The whole thing essentially is going to be different,' Mr. Nemec said. 'The actual property itself — the way Funk Fest is set — is going to be turned around and moved all around. It’s going to give us a lot more festival space than last year. It’s going to definitely let everyone spread their wings a little bit and enjoy the property more.'\nTim Reynolds & TR3\nThis year, he promises to have more than 15 vendors in the 'indie' market, which will have merchants offering a variety of goods from hammocks to tied-yed clothing to jewelry. Added to the mix will be a professional glass-blower who will creating and selling pieces on site, and a speed painter who will not only offer small-canvas pictures but will also be working on a mural that will progress through the duration of the festival.\nTim Reynolds & TR3\nOther additions include: general admission seating that’s 30 feet closer to the stage, a larger second stage, craft beers and boutique wines offered to both VIP and general admission ticketholders and a food truck village.\nIf putting together Funk Fest sounds like a lot of work, it is.\n'Funk Fest 7 last year was March 4 and 5,' Mr. Nemec said. 'I think we started on Funk Fest 8 on March 9 and 10. We gave ourselves a couple of days’ reprieve, and then started hitting it up and trying to get the acts put together. It takes a full year to put together the event now.'\nGiant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad\nAs with previous years, the musical acts will perform on two stages, trading off so that when one band finishes on one stage, the next band begins on another.\nThe reason band selection begins a year in advance is because, (1) there are 15 of them, and (2) attendees of past festivals make suggestions on other bands they’d like to hear. The Nemecs also target their own favorites that they feel are a good fit — including the perennial appearance of Here Come the Mummies.\n'This year, we have the world-famous Neville family (Dumpstaphunk, led by Ivan Neville, son of singer Aaron Neville) headlining on Saturday,' Mr. Nemec said. 'We have Jim Reynolds, the lead guitarist for the Dave Matthews Band. They’re going to be headlining on Friday night. Then there’s Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad, which is No. 1 on the Billboard chart for reggae. The list goes on. It’s pretty incredible the lineup this year.'\nMummy Rah shows off his soul to Bob White and Lori White at Funk Fest 7 last year.\nThe Motet, from Colorado, is the biggest festival band right now on the circuit, he added.\n'The Motet is really one of the sleeper bands that people around here might not know, but they’re really well known on the West Coast of the United States. They’re going to be a band that will leave your mouth wide open, and you’re going to want more. They are high energy, high octane, with amazing musicianship.'\nThe only tickets left to Funk Fest 8 are general admissions seats. The 'exclusive' weekend pass tickets — selling at a whopping $1,500 a pop — sold out two months ago. The $130 'premier' were nearly gone before the end of February. And it would surprise no one if this year’s crowds exceed 4,000. Why not?\nTara Nemec, Ashley Shaffer and Ginny Cormeny felt so good at Funk Fest 7.\n'This is an all-day, all-weekend music festival that never stops,' Mr. Nemec said. 'The music is going to be world class, mostly in the funk genre but also a lot of jazz and rock and even some country infusion. It’s a little bit for everybody. I don’t think anyone would come and say they didn’t like the music.\n'And it’s not just music — it’s art. It’s a lifestyle. It’s great cocktails, craft beers, food. It’s going to encompass a lot of cool things.' ¦\n>> What: Funk Fest 8\n>> When: 3:30 p.m. to midnight Friday, March\n3;1:30 p.m. to midnight Saturday, March 4\n>> Where: Punta Gorda City Marketplace,\nacross from River City Grill\n>> Cost: Advance tickets: $50 for both days,\n$25 for Friday only, $35 for Saturday only.\n>> Tickets and information: www.FunkFestPuntaGorda.com\nDumpstaphunk\n\n\n\n",

         "Fu Ni had zoo staff in a flap over a pregnancy that never happened. Photo: Zoos SA Adrian Mann\nAdelaide Zoo has confirmed its female giant panda Fu Ni was not pregnant over the last few months despite her behaviour strongly suggesting she was experiencing labour.\nIt was the zoo's third attempt at helping the panda and her mate, Wang Wang, become parents as mature adults and increase the species' population, which currently stands at less than 1900 in the wild.\nFu Ni has adopted a toy that she has been cradling and holding close to her chest since the false alarm.\nZoos SA senior panda keeper Simone Davey said the zoo had artificially inseminated panda Fu Ni twice in October.\nShe said hormonal changes and changes in her uterus had given them hope Fu Ni had become pregnant.\nRelated Coverage\nMs Davey said Fu Ni experienced contractions and heavy breathing over the weekend that were consistent and common for pandas going into pseudo labour.\n\"It's like a learning curve or a training mechanism for giant pandas, so they have less mismothering the first time round,\" she said.\n\"It gives them the experience to become better mothers when they are actually pregnant.\"\nMs Davey explained the large ratio difference in size between mother and foetus meant ultrasounds could not detect a cub until the last two weeks of pregnancy, which gave the keepers hope that her behaviour meant she was going into labour.\nShe said Fu Ni had experienced re-absorption, which is when all the remnants of a foetus in a failed pregnancy are absorbed back into the body, following past inseminations.\nIt meant there were no physical signs of that pregnancy having taking place.\nThis year, however, progress was made as Fu Ni went into the next stage of pseudo pregnancy, giving Zoos SA staff hope of more success in the next breeding season.\n\"This year also was the first time we saw all these other behaviours like the false labour so we've actually got new information that we haven't seen before that will help us a lot in the future,\" Ms Davey said.\nWang Wang and Fu Ni are the only giant pandas in the southern hemisphere and were given to Adelaide Zoo at young ages so they could naturally adapt to the environment.\n\"Because we are the guinea pigs, it is a unique experience. Hopefully this breeding season we'll see some more improvements,\" Ms Davey said.\nOn previous occasions of pseudo pregnancy, Fu Ni's tendency to rub herself on objects had been considered a nesting behaviour (see gif below).\nhttp://1v1d1e1lmiki1lgcvx32p49h8fe.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AliveCheeryAstrangiacoral.webm\n-ABC\n",

The Harpursville zoo said that April hasn't changed much physically but that there has been \"significant movement once again in the belly.\"\nApril and Oliver: Love Story Behind Famous Giraffe's Pregnancy\nA cold front moves into the northeast on Thursday and the zoo suggested this might \"shake things up.\" Other than the belly movement, April's keeper and vet also documented \"increased tail raising and holding,\" as well as \"periods of increased movement/pace\" Wednesday night.\nOver the last week, April has captivated tens of millions of people across the world who have been checking in on her via the live stream in anticipation of the birth of her fourth calf.\nSome 60,000 people were tuned in to the stream at the crack of dawn Thursday. The graceful giraffe appeared calm and collected as she picked at stray pieces of hay and stretched around to scratch a back itch. Watch it above.\nThe zoo, which unveiled April-inspired emojis and t-shirts as the fan base for the 15-year-old long-necked beauty continues to swell, said twin Barbados lambs and a Patagonian Cavy were born early Wednesday.\nNY Zoo Giraffe Stream Banned for 'Nudity' Back After Outcry\n\"Babies babies everywhere!\" the Animal Adventure Park posted Wednesday morning. \"Just not yet in the giraffe barn.\"\nApril's pregnancy was catapulted into global headlines last week after YouTube briefly yanked the zoo's live stream following complaints by animal activists that it violated the site's policies concerning \"nudity and sexual content.\" Thousands upon thousands of commenters voiced their frustration on Facebook and YouTube, and the stream was restored within an hour or so.\nGiraffe pregnancies last for 15 months. Labor lasts anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Once April goes into active labor, zookeepers will go in to help her the rest of the way. The calf will be about 150 pounds and 6 feet tall at birth and up and walking in about an hour.\nThe zoo said it will hold an online competition to name the baby giraffe once it's born.\nUS-Born Panda Bao Bao Lands in China After Leaving DC Zoo\nPublished 4 hours ago | Updated 2 hours ago\n",

        "Text"=>
         "Adelaide Zoo has confirmed its female giant panda Fu Ni was not pregnant over the last few months despite her behaviour strongly suggesting she was experiencing labour.\nIt was the zoo's third attempt at helping the panda and her mate, Wang Wang, become parents as mature adults and increase the species' population, which currently stands at less than 1,900 in the wild.\nPanda facts:\nWang Wang was born in August 2005 and Fu Ni a year later at Woolong giant panda research centre in China\nThey were given to Adelaide Zoo in late 2009 for a decade but Adelaide officials hope China might agree to extend their stay\nBoth are part of an international giant panda research, conservation and breeding program aimed at preserving the endangered species\nFu Ni has adopted a toy that she has been cradling and holding close to her chest since the false alarm.\nZoos SA senior panda keeper Simone Davey said the zoo had artificially inseminated panda Fu Ni twice in October.\nShe said hormonal changes and changes in her uterus had given them hope Fu Ni had become pregnant.\nMs Davey said Fu Ni experienced contractions and heavy breathing over the weekend that were consistent and common for pandas going into pseudo labour.\n\"It's like a learning curve or a training mechanism for giant pandas, so they have less mismothering the first time round,\" she said.\n\"It gives them the experience to become better mothers when they are actually pregnant.\"\nMs Davey explained the large ratio difference in size between mother and foetus meant ultrasounds could not detect a cub until the last two weeks of pregnancy, which gave the keepers hope that her behaviour meant she was going into labour.\nShe said Fu Ni had experienced re-absorption, which is when all the remnants of a foetus in a failed pregnancy are absorbed back into the body, following past inseminations.\nIt meant there were no physical signs of that pregnancy having taking place.\nThis year, however, progress was made as Fu Ni went into the next stage of pseudo pregnancy, giving Zoos SA staff hope of more success in the next breeding season.\n\"This year also was the first time we saw all these other behaviours like the false labour so we've actually got new information that we haven't seen before that will help us a lot in the future,\" Ms Davey said.\nWang Wang and Fu Ni are the only giant pandas in the southern hemisphere and were given to Adelaide Zoo at young ages so they could naturally adapt to the environment.\n\"Because we are the guinea pigs, it is a unique experience. Hopefully this breeding season we'll see some more improvements,\" Ms Davey said.\nOn previous occasions of pseudo pregnancy, Fu Ni's tendency to rub herself on objects had been considered a nesting behaviour.\nExternal Link:\nFu Ni's scratching had been considered a nesting behaviour.\nTopics:\nFirst posted March 02, 2017 14:05:22\n",

         "> Industry > PR & SEOs Listen Up! HitTail is Back to Make You Panda Proof\nPR & SEOs Listen Up! HitTail is Back to Make You Panda Proof\nExactly a year ago today, you may have spotted the relaunch of HitTail... or you may have totally missed it  like I did. New CEO, Rob Walling's plan was to quietly relaunch his new acquisition with as little fanfare as possible. It was a Facebook ad for HitTail, saying SEO Is Dead, which got my attention at the beginning of this year. And, truthfully, to see the ad was like welcoming back an old friend.\nThat is because HitTail is one of my favorite keyword tools of all time.\nYes, I'd forgotten its name, but for most of 2012, I regularly thought to myself, \"with what's happening with Panda, what people really need now is that longtail keyword tool developed by that PR company.\" Despite its almost ludicrous simplicity, HitTail has always done the one thing it does really well  namely, identifying the long tail keyword opportunities you should optimize content for.\nHitTail was first launched in 2006. It was the brainchild of Connie Connors, the CEO of New York PR company, Connors Communication. Compared to the average SEO keyword research tools, HitTail never looked like anything special  but it always punched above it's weight, winning lots of coverage in mainstream media.\nAs  said before, HitTail is a ludicrously simple tool. Anyone can make use of it with next to no SEO knowledge. As Cnet called it back then, in a time when blogs were still the hot new thing  it's \"analytics for the rest of us.\"\nHitTail's Backstory\nLike many keyword and analytics companies founded at the time, HitTail had to contend with Google Analytics being made freely available to everyone who would have previously bought analytics. But HitTail was always a pretty low cost tool that was remarkably good at maintaining clients.\nAround 2009 the software was starting to show it's age, suffering from downtime and bugs were creeping in. In 2010, Rob Walling, a HitTail customer of 5 years, emailed Connors and offered to buy the software. Connors agreed to an undisclosed sum and sold the software and the servers it sat on (remember in 2005 when we all had our own servers?) to Walling.\nWalling is an interesting type of web entreprenuer. He has a team of developers and buys old software companies and refurbishes their products. He then runs the new product on as much as it needs to be profitable (This is not too dissimilar to what Jim Boykin is doing with Webmaster World and Threadwatch which relaunched yesterday ). Walling calls this micropreneurship .\nSetting to work, Walling's team cleared up the 28 or so bugs that had crept into the system, hired a database administrator and moved the entire software as a service (SaaS) to the cloud. All the keywords tracked have been maintained such that some clients now have a 5 year archive of keywords that sit outside of the Googleplex.\nRelaunched exactly a year ago, via a quick post on Hacker News , Walling's new HitTail has suffered no downtime and the improved database means current customers have seen their keyword suggestions increase ten fold. Profits have also increased ten fold, meaning more resources can be re-invested to improve the product.\nSo far, whilst there has been no major functionality change to HitTail, under the new leadership, the software platform now has quick integration with Hubspot, may develop better AdWords integration and a WordPress plugin will be released next week.\nWhat Does It Do?\nAll HitTail does is track all your incoming keywords to your site, stack them against each other in a bar graph and then identify which are the best long tail opportunities for you personally. It's magic is in a simple algorithm which identifies the keywords you should write more about based on the keywords that are driving traffic to your site.\nWhat You Write About Can Rank\nBack then in 2006, for the average SEO, such an analysis could seem like a pursuit of diminishing returns. The labor required to produce the content was most likely not worth the traffic gains. Content production was a chore and most businesses were not open to it  they didn't get why content was important.\nSEO was about gaining big traffic wins in a competitive environment, so we would turn to tools like WordTracker which was excellent at comparing traffic volume against competitiveness. But Wordtracker never had a simple solution for understanding the compeitiveness of the keyword phrases you were already attracting  which, in a nutshell, is exactly what HitTail does.\nSpeaking personally, as a freelance SEO, in a dead heat between the two tools, WordTracker would usually win my money, yet nonetheless, I still found myself paying for HitTail every now and then on their month to month plans for certain new clients.\nThat's because HitTail's data is eminently actionable. It's as actionable as panhandling for gold and finding a nugget. If you don't find that nugget, you move elsewhere, but if you do, boy oh boy, do you take action. Essentially HitTail automates the process of panhandling for potentially golden keyword phrases from all your incoming search query data.\nWhat it lacks in robust analysis it makes up for in total clarity. The SEO tenet it is based on is so simple, so utterly uncomplex, that it took a PR person (someone who lives and breathes content) to boil it down for the rest of the industry.\nNamely, \"What you write about can rank.\" It's true! Regardless of algorithms, links and anchor text, this little fact of the internet elucidates the inalienable right of content creators on the web. Anyone can write about anything, and all of it can rank on search engines.\nThe question then remains: Now that you know you have that freedom, regardless of whether you will succeed or not, what do you want to rank for?\nEvery SEO Needs To Return To That One Simple Idea\nSEOs can be forgiven for believing that HitTail's analysis is an over simplification  a philosophical stretch too far to be considered a robust SEO tool. It could fairly be dismissed as a better tool for Bloggers. Nonetheless, with boots firmly in the SEO camp, I beg to differ.\nHitTail originated from blog land amongst a subset of web users who, from the beginning have been conceptualizing their own web marketing efforts in terms of relationships rather than links, and content rather than keywords. To bloggers, incoming search traffic has just been another channel to grow an audience and develop a more personal relationship with their readers. Bloggers don't write to rank on search engines, they write for people in order to grow their community  whatever search traffic they got was just a bonus.\nPR professionals who get SEO are the same. They understand that search traffic is out there, but beyond search, the aim of PR is to make the message land on listening ears. Where SEOs see cumulative traffic stats, PR professionals see tiny niches of influencers that they can target.\nThat the way in which SEO and PR services are packaged up for clients is completely different, points to core methodological differences in our approaches to online marketing.\nYet, we're not so different as we think. Where SEOs need to be on a monthly retainer to do link development until rankings pay off, PR professionals need to be on a monthly retainer to do story development, until the big placement pays off.\nSEO companies aim to get their client on the front page of Google and Bing, whilst PR companies aim to get their client on the front page of the Wall Street Journal.\nIn the wake of Panda and Penguin, Google's message is clear. Links need to be won through a blend of cunning search strategy and equally cunning PR strategy. Google may have a war on links but it is certainly not a war on relationships. Google's radual socialization of search results is simply changing the link building model to one more of earned media (and arguably what is was always meant to be).\nYet that is not to say, SEO is now PR or vice versa. But both can learn from each other. As Ken McGaffin, former marketer for WordTracker so brilliantly states in 10 Reasons Why Public Relations is a ‘Must-do' for SEO in 2013 , there's a tremendous cascade effect on links as a result of good PR.\nWhat PR knows is that one good article with the right placement (normally a publication) is the difference between getting picked up by the journalist community and going nowhere. What SEOs know is that good rankings on a few terms can bring even more good rankings for many more terms in the long run. Todd Malicoat has always put that ranking phenomenon best, \"all ships rise with the tide.\"\nSo what if the placement of that one good article happens to be at the top of search results? That's the core idea HitTail sells the SEO community and that idea is fundamentally Panda proof.\nHitTail enables bloggers, journalists and SEOs to find that one good keyword that has the best chance of getting that one good placement on the front page of Google. The rest flows from there. Hopefully your story will get picked up and linked to by higher order publications and you will have naturally improved your link profile.\nUltimately, We Earn Our Keywords\nIf you are an SEO, you'll know this better than most: that  one top ranking for a long tail keyword is the crack that lets the light in. From the success of one phrase you can divine the current and future success of your entire SEO strategy. But Google's has spent a year taking our keywords away from us and burying it in webmaster tools.\nAll webmasters should consider that they have earned, fairly and squarely, the keyword data that sent traffic to your website. If Google is going to encrypt data and block tools  that are useful to the functioning of your business and critically important to understanding your customers  then it might be time to start thinking about how you can take that data out of Google as soon as you can.\nUltimately Google can touch and peek into every other apsect of web data, but it still can't touch your own website data or take that away from you. Regardless of the ethics of Google SPYWorld and encrypted referrers, every public piece of keyword data I have ever analyzed was fairly earned by the websites I own, manage, funded or created.\nThe Bottom Line\nThere's no doubt that I am gushing with enthusiasm for HitTail. By no means was it perfect back then, and in a Skype conversation, Walling candidly admitted to some imperfections now. For many users it will still be frustrating that related keyword suggestions are still not searchable. It's still an incredibly simplistic piece of software.\nHowever, this refurbishment is a step in the right direction. With new resources and a profitable future ahead of it, Walling plans to develop the product according to what users ask for.\nWhilst I already have a list as long as my arm for new feature requests, simply what HitTail's can do for me now is important enough. HitTail can take my keyword data out of the machinations of the Googleplex and put it back into my hands.\nSimilarly HitTail has preserved the keyword list their clients have earned for over 5 years now, therefore that tool seems like a good insurance plan to me against a keywordless future. From my discussions with Walling it seems clear to me that there could be an opportunity for customers to help formulate the direction of the service  and right now, post-Panda and post Google SPYWorld, the SEO community needs a new keyword tool.\nFor the record, my dream is that HitTail and Wordtracker team up and make babies.\nWant to stay on top of the latest search trends?\nGet top insights and news from our search experts.\n",

         "Shares have been moving up lately in Spirent Communications (LSE: SPT) the provider of test methodologies and solutions for data communications and in Nichols (LSE: NICL) the soft drinks manufacturer. So, is there anything in today's full-year results from these firms to halt the momentum or does progress look set to continue?\nAll looking good\nHeadline figures for Nichols include revenue up 7.4% compared to a year ago, an operating profit rise of 9% and adjusted earnings per share ticking 9.7% higher. That all looks good, but the best figure of all is the directors' hiking of the full-year dividend by 15.3%. I think that move speaks volumes about the how they see the health of the business and its prospects.\nAfter reflecting on \"another very good year\", non-executive chairman John Nichols said he expects the firm's clear strategy for growth to overcome challenging soft drinks markets during 2017. His confidence is underpinned by the company's strong brands, diversification and successful track record of growth.\nThose all-important brands include names such as Vimto, Panda, Sunkist, Levi Roots and Feel Good Drinks. As well as diversity of brands, the firm has sales diversified across markets with Vimto, for example, selling in more than 85 countries. Meanwhile, its track record of growth speaks for itself.\nYear to December\n2011\n",

This led the pair to create HighlyRated.com, where users are encouraged to Rate or Hate videos based on their merit. Videos that are then the most 'rated' will appear on the site's homepage, providing the user with higher visibility and connectivity.\n\n\n\nCommenting on HighlyRated.com's launch, Co-Founder and CEO Acer Jamal said, \"Beta testing of the site was beyond positive  even with very optimistic expectations, we're delighted with the response so far. Having lived in the UAE on & off for over 20 years, we chose to launch our Middle East office here in UAE due to its reputation as a hub for entrepreneurship. The Middle East is our focus before we expand outward, instead of the other way round, which has been the case with nearly every other social network.\"\n\n\n\nUsers are now encouraged to sign up for the video-based social network by visiting  http://www.HighlyRated.com  .

That should stop people leaving quite so many angry comments under stories, they hope.\nStories that use the quiz will see people presented with three short multiple choice questions that they must give the correct response to. So, for instance, people might have to correctly answer what an acronym that is used in the story stands for, for instance.\nTrump confused with Alec Baldwin's SNL impersonation by newspaper\nThe creators of the tool – which for the moment is in use on NKRbeta, the broadcasters' tech page – hope that it will ensure that everyone knows what they're talking about before they actually start talking about it.\n\"We thought we should do our part to try and make sure that people are on the same page before they comment,\" journalist Ståle Grut told Nieman Lab, which first reported the news . If everyone can agree that this is what the article says, then they have a much better basis for commenting on it.'\nThe extra time should also force people to think a little more deeply about what they are commenting on.\n'If you spend 15 seconds on it, those are maybe 15 seconds that take the edge off the rant mode when people are commenting,' said Marius Arnesen, editor of NKRbeta.\nMost of NKRbeta has developed a dedicated following who talk positively in the comments on its articles. But occasionally its stories are published on the homepage or elsewhere – which brings a whole new set of often angry readers, who tend to undermine the tone in the comments, said NKRbeta journalists.\nMany sites have got rid of comments altogether, arguing that they are becoming hard to maintain, tend to become negative quickly and that people can have their own conversations on Facebook or elsewhere.\nOther websites have attempted to tackle the problem with different technologies. Google announced last week, for instance, that it had built an artificially intelligent tool that can read through comments and identify whether or not they are \"toxic\".\nMore about:\nNewspapers\n",

         "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild review: Nintendo has created an almost perfect Zelda game | The Independent",
        "Text"=>
         "If you’ve pre-ordered a Nintendo Switch , chances are you’re a feisty Nintendo fan eagerly awaiting the latest addition to the Zelda series, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild . Your faith, dear Nintendo worshippers, has not been misplaced as Breath of the Wild marks a fantastic addition to the already mighty series. \nBreath of the Wild sees our elf-like adventurer wake from a 100-year slumber with no memory and Calamity Ganon ruling over Hyrule. From here, Link must piece together his memories, discover his true purpose, and attempt to save the world and Princess Zelda. If losing his memory wasn’t bad enough, Link must also free four gigantic divine beasts and traverse an open world where almost everything is deadly.\nThis, of course, marks the most significant and overwhelmingly positive change to happen to the long running series. Breath of the Wild may be the 19th main-series Zelda game but it’s the first to be completely open-world. Being free to roam the expansive (read: overwhelmingly huge) pastures of Hyrule is magnificent. \nWant to delve into a shrine you spotted seemingly miles away? You can! Want to forget the main quest and document everything on your camera? You can! Want to speak to the local village and complete side quests? You can! Want to spend all your time feeding apples to your horse? You can! The possibilities feel limitless. And for those wanting to complete the main quest, there’s a quasi-structure that requires a lot of exploration but nearly always makes you feel that you’re progressing. \n \nA little on the aforementioned shrines: unlike in previous Zelda games where each cave was few and far between but were long and challenging, the new system means caves are relatively short, offering one or two major challenges. However, there are dozens upon dozens spread throughout Hyrule so their brevity doesn’t matter as another challenge awaits around the corner. Importantly, completing each shrine rewards you an orb: four of these you can exchange for either a heart container or more stamina. You'll need to upgrade these sooner rather than later because, guess what, you'll be dying. A Lot. We're talking dozens and dozens of times. It's wonderfully challenging. \nAnother major new change to the series is that swords, shields, and bows break relatively often, meaning you will have to find new equipment to use. This can be frustrating, as your favourite sword won’t be around very long if you're swinging like a mad man. Luckily, each enemy drops their weapon when they perish, meaning you can save that favourite sword for when the inevitable boss appears. One little nitpick here is that the system to select weapons is slightly difficult to maneuver: obviously, it was built with the Wii U’s second screen in mind.

The Slate has two functions: firstly, it provides a map that can be used to create waypoints and see where major quests need you to go. Second, as you progress, you acquire runes that give Link certain powers, such as creating bombs and stopping objects from moving for a limited amount of time. \nThese different powers are used to traverse different obstacles in unique ways, offering enough variety and upgradeability to keep you more than occupied. The only disappointing Rune is the literal camera, which can be used to capture creatures, monsters, and areas, adding their picture to your compendium. Compared to bombs, it’s not exactly exciting. \nOf course, there are core Zelda mainstays that keep Breath of the Wild a Zelda game. Not only are Zelda, Link and Gannon back, but so are the classic sounds, Rupees, and some enemies. The combat system also remains similar, with swords, bombs, and your bow and arrow remaining the main way to defeat enemies.\nNintendo Switch review: the ultimate handheld released too soon\nHaving been in production so long, many fans have been worried about the game’s graphics. On Nintendo Switch, the stylised look works fantastically, even on the small screen. On TV, though, the game comes into its element, the long draw distance being absolutely breath-taking. More importantly, though, like that Lion King meme, everything you see can be yours (to explore). \nThat’s just the half of what Breath of the Wild has to offer. Earlier, I called it ‘overwhelming,’ which has somewhat negative connotations. At times, there feels like there is just so much to explore - where do you begin? But, somehow, Breath of the Wild keeps you on track. You don’t feel lost at any stage as you know, quite simply, that Ganon needs to be defeated. By keeping things simple while giving you seemingly infinite things to do, Nintendo has created an almost perfect Zelda game and one I can’t put down. A must-have for any Nintendo lover.\nReuse content\n",

But Nintendo has confirmed that it is a way of discouraging children from licking or eating the tiny cards.\nPeople who have licked or attempted to eat the cartridges have found the experience awful. The taste also has a tendency to linger, according to games journailst Jeff Gerstman, whose advice after putting one in his mouth was \"do not try this at home\".\n\"Immediately upon touching a Nintendo Switch cartridge one’s tongue is assaulted by a harsh bitterness that spreads like a brush fire through the mouth,\" wrote Mike Fahey on gaming website Kotaku. \"Having a drink on hand helps, but not completely.\n\"The taste and how it spreads suggests some sort of oily residue left on the cartridge. If you’ve ever pinched an orange peel and tasted the oil that oozes from the rind, it’s like that, only without the citrus accents.\"\nMr Fahey suggested that he could taste some of the same flavour on cartridges from the old Nintendo Entertainment System and the Super NES, but that it was a more faint taste and it didn't stick around.\nReuse content\n",

        "Text"=>
         "Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast\nExcerpt\nHere’s How to Avoid a War With China\nIn Avoiding War With China, Amitai Etzioni says that even optimists give the U.S. and China only a one-in-four chance of peace. He thinks those odds can be improved.\nAmitai Etzioni\n03.02.17 6:00 AM ET\nIf you are the betting type, I have a promising bet for you. Wager that the United States and China will engage in a major war in the near future. Some scholars who specialize in international relations, such as John Mearsheimer, contend that a war between the United States and China is more likely today than a 'hot' war between the United States and the USSR ever was. Timothy Garton Ash, a British historian and commentator, states that the United States and China will 'probably' go to war if they do not carefully manage the slew of points of tension between them. Michael Pillsbury, an expert with four decades of experience studying U.S.-China relations, observes that China’s lack of military transparency practically guarantees inadvertent escalation, leading to war.\nOthers consider a war with China inevitable because of an 'iron law' of history, according to which prevailing superpowers such as the United States necessarily fail to yield power quickly enough to a new power such as China, thereby causing rising tensions and, eventually, war. Graham Allison writes, 'The defining question about global order for this generation is whether China and the United States can escape Thucydides’s Trap. The Greek historian’s metaphor reminds us of the attendant dangers when a rising power rivals a ruling power … [Avoiding war] required huge, painful adjustments in attitudes and actions on the part not just of the challenger but also the challenged.' Even optimists, against whom you’d be betting, give the United States and China only a one in four chance of avoiding war. According to Allison’s report, superpowers adjusted and avoided war with rising powers in four out of sixteen cases since 1500. (In one of these cases, Great Britain yielded to the United States during the late 1800s and early 1900s.)\nThis book hopes to sour your bet (with due apologies) by outlining several policies that may allow us to achieve a peaceful transition of power without endangering the United States’ core interests in Southeast Asia—or undermining the United States’ position as a global power. To find a peaceful way, both the United States and China need to change their foreign policies. Scores of books and articles argue what China must do: stop its military buildup, improve its transparency, bring its military more under the control of the government rather than the Communist Party, and transition to a liberal democracy, among other recommendations. This book, in contrast, is written by an American for Americans; it focuses on the actions the United States could take to reduce the probability that the world will face another major war.\nI cannot stress enough that when I point in the following pages to flaws in the ways that the United States is currently dealing with China (for instance, by excluding it from the Trans Pacific Partnership), this does not mean that China has conducted itself better or does not need to mend its ways. It simply means that China’s warts have been amply charted and dissected; this book focuses on what the United States could do better.\nTo proceed, Americans need to engage in a national dialogue, a public debate about what the United States’ China policy is and should be. The United States often engages in such debates about other subjects, such as same-sex marriage, climate change, dealing with ISIS and with Iran. Such a national debate about China policy has not yet happened.\nIndeed, during the most recent presidential primary season, both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates have mainly avoided the subject, though Donald Trump argued that China is out to 'eat our lunch.' Now that the elections are over, and a new administration has come in, this is a particularly opportune time to engage in such a public debate. This book seeks to serve this overdue give-and-take.\nGoing to or sliding into war with a rising China is especially tragic because—as I see it—China and the United States share many complementary interests and have surprisingly few substantive reasons to come to blows. (By 'substantive' I mean those issues that are distinct from symbolic or hyped-up ones, such as the question of who owns a pile of rocks somewhere difficult to find on a map.)\nSome use the terms 'panda huggers' and 'dragon slayers' to categorize analysts and public leaders in the West according to the approaches they recommend adopting toward China; these terms replace the 'doves' and 'hawks' of the Cold War. (I sometimes refer to them as 'Engagers' and 'Adversarians.')\nSome might consider this book to fall on the dovish side. However, I am not a 'panda hugger' but rather someone who has been to war. This experience left me with a strong commitment to seeking peaceful resolutions to international conflicts.\nThe overdue public debate about America’s China policy will not take place in a vacuum. The U.S. military, in the course of carrying out its duty to secure the United States, has identified China as a major strategic threat. Accordingly, it has made the case in the media, in congressional hearings, and in presentations to the White House that the United States should take a tougher approach to China and should build up its military in order to prepare for a war with China. The defense industry supports the same charge for its own reasons. To digress, I do not claim that there exists a military-industrial complex in the sense of a solid military-corporate bloc whose representatives meet at night in a motel in Arlington to plot how to gain glory and profit by pushing the United States into war with China. As a matter of fact, the U.S. military’s various services compete with each other; thus the U.S. Army is much less inclined to target China than the U.S. Air Force and Navy are. And many corporations that make money out of peaceful pursuits compete with defense-focused ones, and defense corporations compete with each other. However, as we shall see, major segments of the military and corporations do have strong, vested interests in preparing for war with China for reasons that do serve their constituents, but not necessarily the good of the United States.\nReprinted from the forthcoming AVOIDING WAR WITH CHINA: Two Nations, One World by Amitai Etzioni by permission of the University of Virginia Press.\nAmitai Etzioni is University Professor in the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies at George Washington University.

         "Festival line-up update: Weezer Cruise, Creamfields, Lovebox and more\nBy Aly Barchi | Published on Thursday 30 May 2013\nAs cheap 'early bird' Field Day tickets go on sale for 2014 (already!), and London's Steve Aoki/Eddie Halliwell headlined SW4 finally (finally!) finalises its line-up via star attraction Sven Vath et al, so too are a plethora of other fests adding extra  if not final  appeal in the shape of new names.\nTake the Croatia-based Terraneo, for instance, as has called on Wu Tang Clan to share prime billing with My Bloody Valentine and The Prodigy. Or Serbia's 'R:Evolution'-themed Exit, which now features EDM renaissance men David Guetta, Steve Angello and Mark Knight. And/or a brand new event at the QE Olympic Park in London, Open East Festival, an internationally-inclined celebration that so far stars Toots And The Maytals, Amadou & Mariam, Fatoumata Diawara, Don Letts, Wire and Stealing Sheep.\nOr Yorkshire's specialist music/beer/cider/fun fete Galtres, the MD of which, one James Houston, says this of persuading Johnny Borrell to play: \"Johnny Borrell will be playing Razorlight smash hits like 'America', 'Somewhere Else' and 'In The Morning' as well as brand new material which is sounding superb.

        "Text"=>
         "March 2, 2017\nMy time in the Hong Kong dugout\nOur correspondent gets a different perspective on an Associates game\nAnshy Rath makes his maiden List A hundred in the first game   Panda Man\nUnder a tent too low for former seam bowlers from England, Simon Cook , formerly of Middlesex and Kent, tries to find me a chair. He looks every bit the former athlete; you can see how he took 342 first-class wickets.  When he finds me a chair and puts it next to him, I may not literally be his right-hand man, but for this one-dayer (a List A game, not an official ODI) between Hong Kong and Netherlands , I'm sitting to the right of Hong Kong's coach.\nThat will be my place for the next two games. For the first half of the match, I'm afraid of moving in case I break some sort of PMOA (players media officials access) code, so I don't even go to the toilet. And also because the Netherlands manager has made it clear he is not happy I am here.\nCook sits at a trestle table. He has a laptop open and a notebook. Behind his laptop is a big screen, and next to that screen is the analyst Chris \"Wilson\" Pickett's laptop, which is running the Sports Mechanics analyst software. Pickett looks like the kind of wiry opening bat who would annoy you by playing and missing a lot. He previously worked with Sussex, and coaches Hong Kong Dragons, the Hong Kong Chinese team.\nHong Kong are fielding. Cook doesn't give a big speech just before play; they just get out there and do their jobs. Opening bowler Ehsan Nawaz starts the day with five wides. There will be another wide and a misfield in the first over.\nBut there is a bigger problem.\nHong Kong Cricket are pioneers in many ways. They live-stream their games, and not just with a single-camera set-up and the sound of the ground, but with multiple cameras and commentators. The camera crew and producers are experts in their field but not experts in cricket. As the bowler hits the crease, they cut to a sideways view of the game. At other times they focus not on the ball but on close-ups of the stumps. And they regularly put up replays of certain balls ahead of live cricket.\nThis drives Pickett crazy, as it's his job to enter all the data in. At times he has to run between overs and try to train the crews on how to cover the game. For the second game he puts up his own camera and uses that. Associate teams realise that embracing data, as many of the big teams have done, will give them certain advantages. At this level, you can only afford so many mistakes .\nOnce they start getting their data, they see something straight away that bothers them. Nawaz is over-correcting. He bowls big inswingers to left-handers, but when he bowls straight, they swing down the leg side, and when he bowls wide, they don't swing and are often called wides.  Hong Kong have been working on this for a while now.\nJamie Atkinson , one of their star batsmen, is at slip. Atkinson was Hong Kong captain and big things were expected of him, but he had to give up the captaincy when he got a job as a teacher. The batsman takes a big swipe at the ball and there is a flashing edge straight to Atkinson. He never sees it. It smashes him on the head. He plays out the game but has no real impact on it. When he continues to feel unwell, he is taken to a doctor and diagnosed with concussion. He doesn't play in the follow-up game.\nPickett and Cook look at the early groupings from their seamers. They are bowling full and wide when the plan was to bowl shorter and very straight, almost on the leg-and-middle line. From their data and planning, they have seen that both batsmen like the front foot, so banging it into the deck also gives their bowlers more room for error. Cook asks 16-year-old Jhatavedh Subramanyan , the 13th man, to pass the message on to Aizaz Khan, the other opening bowler. Hong Kong today have four teenagers in the XI, the youngest being 17. In the next game they have five.\nHayat is calm, Rath is eager. Rath tries to push the game forward, Hayat tries to slow it down. They both handle pace and spin. They both look like natural batsmen and as if they intimately understand how to construct a one-day chase\nSubramanyan runs off to fine leg with the message. Aizaz starts his next over with a half-volley, which is driven for four. A couple of balls later another full ball is driven away. Cook looks on silently. Then he turns to me and wonders what happened. Perhaps the message wasn't passed on correctly or forcefully enough. Maybe the bowler decided the advice was wrong and his plan was better. Or it could just be that the bowler doesn't have control of his length enough to execute the right ball.  Later Cook asks me what I think of Bob Woolmer's plan to have an earpiece to talk to the captain. He probably wishes he had them for all his players.\nOffspinner Ehsan Khan takes the wicket of Ben Cooper, and Cook passes on a new note: just bowl for dots. The thinking is that this isn't a wicket where you can attack, so the best way is to make the batsmen play shots they shouldn't be playing. Instead, Netherlands start hitting sixes.\nCook reluctantly leaves the tent for a commentary stint, which has been cleared by the match referee. It's the sort of thing that leading international coaches don't often do.\nIn the 27th over, Hong Kong's batting prodigy, 19-year-old Anshy Rath , comes on to bowl. They worry that Rath, a decent left-arm fingerspinner when in form, might have the yips. He clearly does, and is taken for 16 runs.  In the next match, he's brought on in the 42nd over and goes for 15 runs. Between the games Cook had Rath bowling with his eyes closed, and he bowled perfectly, the problem was, he wasn't going to be able to do that in the match.\nHong Kong's captain, Babar Hayat , is an intriguing tactician. \"Babar has plans that no on this earth can understand,\" Pickett will say of him at one stage.\n\"That's why we get investigated,\" says Pickett about how Hong Kong have had to explain themselves to the ACSU before. \"They think we're fixing, but we've just got a lot of strange ideas.\"\nAfter Rath's over they get a bonus wicket as Ehsan, the spinner and slogger, takes a good catch on the boundary, right in front of the HK tent, and then turns and screams at the team. Someone jokes that he might have been upset with some comments about his fielding. But it turns out that in taking the catch, he has he managed to split the webbing in his fingers. Subramanyan asks if he will go back out there, \"Of course,\" he says, \"this happens all the time.\" Sarah Whitehead, the physio, carefully tries to patch up the problem and quickly gets him back on the field. Ehsan's hands are more tape than fingers. Two overs later he is back off, as his hand is bleeding, and Whitehead goes through the motions again.\nHong Kong continually set fields for Netherlands captain Peter Borren , keeping mid-on and mid-off up. They also put a specialist fielder for the reverse sweep. None of these things bothers Borren. He still plays the reverse sweep. \"Reverse sweep is an ego shot,\" Cook says. Later Borren slaps a straight six.\nCook believes in the roles triangle, which is asking a player to accept his role within the team, train in the skills needed for that role, and then execute it on match days. This isn't easy to explain to players who are the stars of their clubs and don't understand that at this level they might just be role players.\nThere are also problems specific to Hong Kong Cricket. Like, for the longest time, they essentially only had eight players they could confidently pick. They picked the three best fielders from the rest. That was because there isn't much cricket played in Hong Kong. Sometimes players can go three weeks without a game because there simply aren't enough grounds in the country - eight in total if you include all the AstroTurf grounds and the school grounds on which they roll out a temporary wicket.\nThere are also culturally specific problems. One young player was offered the chance to play in an emerging-teams tournament against Sri Lanka and India, but he turned it down because it would interfere with his schooling. Another player, Shahid Wasif , is a student who also works as a security guard from 7pm to 7am.\nBabar Hayat is run out for 86 in the second one-dayer   Panda Man\nNetherlands end with 330 runs. As they eat their lunch, Cook and Pickett discuss the fact that Hong Kong bowled 50% dot balls but also let through a boundary an over. They believe their bowlers think ball by ball, like amateurs, rather than about stringing together good overs and spells.\nCook takes out a whiteboard and writes where he wants the team to be at 15 overs (95 for 2), and where he wants them at 35 (222 for 4).\nBorren bowls the third over after his opener, Vivian Kingma, bowls a shocker, and Cook wistfully says how great it would be to have someone with that sort of experience in his side, who can also do whatever is needed at any time\nThe other opening bowler, Paul van Meekeren , is bowling fast, and some of his balls are tagging sideways. Pickett talks about how they have data on van Meeekeren, and how with the Sports Mechanics app, the players can watch any bowler any time they want to learn more about them.\nThe chat moves to stealing runs, and running in general. The team has just had a revolution in the way they think about running between the wickets, and while they have seen more runs, they have also seen more run-outs.  Cook just wants them to think there is a run every ball, to have that intent.\nAs he talks about this, 19-year-old opener Chris Carter is out there batting. Carter is clearly a talented player, but he is also new to being a specialist batsman. His technique is strong, his eye is decent, but he gets trapped in his innings (he makes 24 from 64 in the next game) and can't find singles. His batting is fine; his run-making needs work.\nAnd it's not just him. Both teams have players who hit boundaries but who don't rotate the strike enough.  Cook wants all his players to know that a defensive shot doesn't just need to go straight back to the bowler. That you can drop your hands, turn your wrists, or even move across the crease before the ball is bowled to change the angle. As he talks about it, Carter is out lbw after not picking the left-arm wristspinner.\nThe concussed Atkinson follows soon after, and at 51 for 2, there is a bit of worry in the team. With Hayat and Rath at the crease, Cook turns his attention to the next batsman, Nizakat Khan .  He tells him they don't need to over-attack, they have time to knock it around and just go at 5.5 an over for the next 20 overs. But if the ball is there to be hit, hit it. You get the feeling that Cook always is a bit cautious with his middle order, because although they don't need much prompting to go full nuclear.\nCook takes a big breath and gets up. After the handshakes he takes his team out to the middle. He speaks softly, like a disappointed teacher. He wants them to know that they played outstandingly well, but from 250 for 2, they threw it away\nCarter comes over to Cook's computer and looks at his lbw a few times, as much as anything to see if it is out, and then to confirm what he thought: he chose the wrong ball to reverse-sweep and didn't pick which way it was spinning. He then looks at a couple of his boundaries. What he doesn't look at is the many balls he didn't score off. For Carter, the boundaries aren't the problem - he will hopefully learn to read wrist spin better. The most simple way he can improve is by facing fewer dots.\nThere is a huge shout behind for Rath's wicket, but the umpire is unmoved. A message from the middle at drinks confirms that he had smashed it. Hayat gets dropped, and that noticeably relaxes the team.\nRath and Hayat also batted together for a very long time in the first-class match before the two one-dayers.  Hayat made 173 and 31, Rath 98 not out and 88.\nThe two of them are so different. Rath looks well coached, thinks cleverly about the game, and you can feel him itching to score. When he goes over mid-off, it is as cricket is intended. He has great feet and hands. A middle-order player at his best, thrust into the top of the Hong Kong order, in the last few months he has finally made the most of his obvious batting talent. Very soon he will sign with a county .\nHayat plays languid strokes and hits the ball smoothly. There have been worries about his fitness. Often he plays one big innings and then struggles. But here he is, batting beautifully, even if his running between the wickets is at times non-existent (he is run out at a crucial moment in the second one-dayer, because he was ball-watching).\nTheir partnership is well constructed. Hayat is calm, Rath is eager. Rath tries to push the game forward, Hayat tries to slow it down. They both handle pace and spin. They both look like natural batsmen and as if they intimately understand how to construct a one-day chase. At the end of the series Borren says the Hong Kong top order is very good, and he should know just from bowling at Rath and Hayat practically all tour.\nWhen a six is hit into the local apartments, the Hong Kong players cheer, but the coaching staff know that when a ball is hit there, it costs US$100, as you can't go into the private residence to get it back.\nEven with the sixes, Hayat's majestic calm and Rath's professional scoring, the next man in, Nizakat, is very nervous. He sits behind Cook and Pickett, and Cook's calming chats do not do the trick. You can feel his nervous energy, or hear his spikes rattling on the concrete nervously. He asks Pickett how many overs are left for each bowler. Later he asks again. And then one more time. \"Just don't worry about it, go out there and bat,\" Pickett finally tells him. It's quite a thing for the analyst to say, but it's probably what Nizakat now needs to do.\nEhsan Khan appeals for a wicket in the drawn first-class game   Panda Man\nRath brings up his hundred, and Hayat keeps going as well. They need 82 off the final ten overs with eight wickets remaining.  It is not going to be easy, but they could not be in a much better position chasing 331.\nThen Hayat is out stumped to Borren, and despite Hong Kong being ahead in the game, I sense Cook get nervous. He picks up a plastic spoon from the ground and starts playing with it.  I start to see a pattern when Cook is nervous: he will get silent, fixate on something small, and then jump up suddenly to impart some guidance for the next player.\nNizakat, after all his nervousness off the field, looks quite comfortable on it.  He smashes Borren for a six and then flat-bats a van Meekeren short ball back into the apartment complex. Nizakat is an extraordinary talent. He goes from looking like he is about to miss the ball by a foot to creaming it over extra cover for six. He smashed a hundred against the Sydney Thunder bowlers in a practice match before the Big Bash this season, bringing up the milestone in the last over with a six. In the second game against Netherlands, he runs down the wicket at Roelof van der Merwe and plays a squash shot over cover for six.\nWith Nizakat and Rath at the crease, the target comes down to 46 from 36 balls. But at no stage does Cook feel overly confident.\nRath then tries to put away a poor ball from Michael Rippon, but hits it very high and is caught for 134. Rath is fuming as he comes off the ground. His 130 is brilliant, but as he reaches the change room, he screams the sort of word that ESPNcricinfo doesn't publish. Cook leans into me and says, \"It's great to see someone that that kind of anger after they've made a hundred\".\nNizakat hits the next ball straight to long-on.  \"That is brainless,\" Cook says to no one in particular. He writes an angry note in his book before placing it aggressively back on his desk. The whole camp feels edgier now. If Cook was the first to feel really nervous, they've now all joined him.\nIt's 30 off 24 balls with five wickets in hand and no set batsman at the crease. The two batsmen in the middle are so nervous, at one stage one goes down the wrong end to bat at the end of the over. Cook laughs a gallows laugh.\nHe has already spoken to both batsmen out in the middle, and now he goes to the remaining batsmen and talks them through what they need to do. He could not be more calm or clear: We should play van der Merwe out. Van Meekeren will bowl short, use his pace to hit him behind the wicket. And most importantly wait for boundary balls. Netherlands are under just as much pressure as we are.\nThen Ehsan, who had been slogging luckily, is given out lbw. All the Hong Kong players believe it is off the glove and they crowd around the replay, which shows pretty much that. It is an exceptionally poor decision at a very crucial moment. No one mentions that Rath edged a catch early in his innings and wasn't given out.\nNow no players are sitting down, it is too tense, they pace as individuals, but it's a group worry. Cook doesn't send messages out to the middle at the end of each over, he doesn't panic, and he doesn't do much, he just tries to make sure every batsman is prepared and plays sensible cricket.\nA full ball is scooped into the leg side. Netherlands scream \"Catch\", a lone Hong Kong voice screams \"No.\"  And then the catch is taken. Someone says that the tail always do this, someone else says, \"That's why we shouldn't let them in.\"  Another wicket falls, and the talk stops altogether. Cook just refolds his arms.\nWhen a six is hit into the local apartments, the Hong Kong players cheer, but the coaching staff knows that when a ball is hit there, it costs US$100, as you can't go into the private residence to get it back\nThey have consistently lost wickets to shots that were not on. When the ninth wicket falls, Hong Kong need 16 off ten balls. Carter walks up to where his gloves have been drying in the sun and picks them up.  If ever there was a sign that the No. 11, Tanveer Ahmed, is not expected to help them win, it's this. An edged boundary from him gets them close; they need 11 from 8, then ten from the last over. Nadeem Ahmed will face it; van Meekeren will bowl it.\nNadeem mishits the first ball. No run is taken. \"Just gotta get one of those away,\" says Cook. Then a wide from a short ball. Another mishit, another run refused. Then another knocked-back single, which drives Cook mad. Then another wide. Then a taken single. \"Why take it now?\" says Cook. Another single. At no stage has either batsman tried to use the pace of van Meekeren against him. They knew he was going to bowl short. He did bowl short, and they did nothing with it.\nThe batsmen almost exchange bats after a chat. Pickett laughs, Cook just shakes his head in disbelief. They need a six off the last ball to tie. It is mistimed to long-off. They don't even take the single.  Someone mentions net run rate, but it's not the most important thing on people's minds.\nCook takes a big breath and gets up. After the handshakes he takes his team out to the middle. He speaks softly, like a disappointed teacher. He wants them to know that they played outstandingly well, but from 250 for 2, they threw it away. He tells them they were neither calm nor smart, and references another game where the same thing happened. He praises their talent but questions their decision-making. \"We want to make a name for ourselves and we had a chance to do that today.\" He tails off at the end.\nI go back to my seat to pack up.  Cook comes over and asks me what I think about the game. At first I am flattered. I think I have penetrated the inner circle. I am an analyst. But then I realise that in truth, he's just out of answers.\nI tell him that maybe he could have micromanaged more when the collapse started, sent out more notes, been more vocal. But even as I say it, I hedge, because I am not even sure that any of that would have worked. Cook shrugs and goes silent.\nNetherlands will make over 300 again in the next game. Ehsan will over-compensate for his swing again. Hong Kong try will try to execute the correct plan for opener Stephan Myburgh, but the bowlers won't follow through on it. On his whiteboard Cook will write, \"When you get in, go on and win the game\". Rath and Hayat will again make a big partnership but neither will bat through to the end. Nizakat will again thrill, and then get out well before his job is done. And Hong Kong will again struggle with their middle order, and their tail will again not be good enough to complete the win.\nThe game will remind me of something that Cook said after the first loss. \"We can say we are learning, but not if we keep making the same mistakes.\"\nHong Kong, the team with only three proper cricket grounds, have scored over 600 chasing over two games, but without that win, it feels like it's all for nothing.\nIn the second game, I notice one different thing from Cook. Hong Kong had managed to keep the Netherlands top order under pressure much better. Since they were batting too slow, you could sense they were going to attack when van der Merwe came in. Cook realised it after one attacking shot.\nThere are no quiet pauses this time. He is up and tells his 12th man to pass on the message: \"They are going to come at us hard, but if you can hang in there, two quick wickets might come and that will knock the stuffing out of them.\"\nBut just telling his 12th man isn't enough, so he runs over to a sweeper on the boundary and tells him too. Then he runs off and tells another sweeper the same message. If Cook could, he'd tell them all.\nNetherlands do come hard, a chance is created, and it is dropped. The next over, a wicket is taken.  Cook just shrugs his shoulders and goes quiet again.\nJarrod Kimber is a writer for ESPNcricinfo. @ajarrodkimber\n © \nESPN Sports Media Ltd.\n    \n",

         "Asia: Saudi Arabia’s one-stop shop for economic opportunities",
        "Text"=>
         "Asia: Saudi Arabia’s one-stop shop for economic opportunities\n👤  2958 readers have read this article !\nBy 2017-03-02\nBy Ankit Panda\nIn the final days of February, Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, flanked by a 600-strong delegation, embarked on a month-long tour of the Asia-Pacific, where he is visiting Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Japan, China, the Maldives, and, on his way back to the Middle East, Jordan.\nSaudi kings seldom undertake such ambitious regional tours, but King Salman's undertaking is an extension of the kingdom's more ambitious outreach to the Asia-Pacific since King Abdullah's death in 2015.\nSaudi state media and the Royal Court have portrayed the trip as primarily concerned with energy and investment matters, but the broader geopolitical context motivating this rare month-long regional tour by the king merits a closer look.\nThe king's trip can be bifurcated into two tranches: China and Japan will fulfil one set of priorities while the trips to Malaysia, Indonesia, and Maldives satisfy another.\nChina and Japan\nFirst, while crude oil prices have somewhat recovered from their nadir in late 2015 and early 2016, Riyadh remains committed to its longer-term plan to reduce its dependence on oil revenues. In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman's visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world's largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king's attention; no surprise, then, that Salman's Asian itinerary includes stops in the region's two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing's voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran's broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won't play along willingly with Riyadh's geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman's itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam's prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh's interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince's lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king's visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city's incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as 'Ahok'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country's authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL's forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman's arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country's increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it's worth remembering that Riyadh's look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia's broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh's dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

         "A UC Santa Barbara global studies major died in his sleep on Feb. 15 in his Santa Barbara home.\nAnthony 'Tony' JiaQian Tsang was born in Vancouver, Canada, on May 25, 1993. He went to elementary and middle school in Hong Kong before moving to Dallas with his family, where he enrolled in Flower Mound High School.\nAnthony Tsang, described as mischievous yet lighthearted and giving by his loved ones, was the source of many hilarious stories and was known for his carefree, easygoing personality. Photo courtesy of Michelle Lew\nTiana Tsang, Anthony Tsang’s younger sister, said her brother did not care what others thought of him and 'was his own person' who was willing to be friends with anyone.\nTiana Tsang said she never realized how generous her brother was while growing up, but as she reminisced, she realized how much he gave to her. She said Anthony Tsang saved up his allowance to buy her a stuffed animal panda that she wanted for her sixth birthday.\n'He remembered that I wanted it, and he went back to buy it for me,' she said. 'So it’s just like little things that I didn’t really think about at the time but now when I go back, it just really matters to me.'\nTiana Tsang also said her brother was incredibly selfless and always looking out for others.\n'After he passed away, a bunch of his friends came out with stories about him and a lot of things he did, I never knew about, and a lot of us never knew about, that showed how selfless he was,' she said.\nMichelle Lew, Tony’s fiancée, said they did everything together.\n'He was my best friend, the one I shared everything with,' Lew said. 'Since the day we met, for two years, we only spent maybe a total of five nights apart.'\nLew said Anthony could brighten anyone’s day and was able to connect with those around him through his diverse interests and cheerful personality.\n'He was really, for lack of a better word, goofy. He was always messing around, always the silly one, trying to make people laugh,' Lew said.\nLew and Anthony Tsang lived in Santa Barbara together after meeting on Tinder in San Jose two years ago. They owned two Jack-Russell-Chihuahua mixes and enjoyed going to Arroyo Burro Beach together with their dogs.\n'The big thing that stuck out was how we met, because we actually met on Tinder. So that was a one-in-a-million thing,' Lew said. 'The first thing that he messaged me was a pick up line, which was: ‘I’m looking for my next wife on Tinder.’'\nLew said a year after they met, they were engaged and planned to marry after they finished college.\n\n'Everything just fit together by random chance,' Lew said.\nIn high school, Anthony Tsang was on the cross country team with his friend, Jonathan Wyatt. The two were friends all throughout high school.\nWyatt described Anthony Tsang as 'curious and mischievous ... but also extremely charismatic and caring for other people.'\n'It was quite an interesting combination … but it honestly made him a really fun person, and I enjoyed spending a lot of time with him,' Wyatt said.\nWyatt said Anthony Tsang was always getting into trouble in high school and said once he and Anthony Tsang attempted to steal an old computer out of a shed on the high school campus.\nWyatt said even though the scheme was his idea, Anthony Tsang took most of the blame after they were caught.\n'It was the most ridiculous thing ever, so funny,' Wyatt said. 'And Tony was like, man, this always happens to me.' It was great, and honestly I’d give anything just to relive those days again.'\nWyatt said Anthony Tsang’s other friends would describe him as 'someone you could count on, no matter what it was.'\n'I think the fact that we could always count on him really was like one of the bigger takeaways from his personality because no matter what situation you were in ... he wasn’t really one to judge people,' Wyatt said.\nWyatt also said he admired Anthony Tsang’s adventurous personality, which made a 'huge impact' on his own high school experience.\n'He never really had a stop button. It was always go go go,' Wyatt said. 'It was very different from how most people live their life, I feel.'\nTiana Tsang said her brother wanted to be a U.S. ambassador to Mexico because he 'really loved it.'\nHe traveled to Mexico on vacation multiple times with Lew, and Anthony Tsang said he loved how 'nice' and 'chill' everyone was there.\nAccording to Lew, Anthony Tsang was a 'big beer enthusiast,' which she said might have contributed to his love of Mexico.\n'He liked ... just how everyone is so easygoing,' Lew said. 'He liked just sitting on the beach and going in the ocean. He liked how friendly everyone was, just something about Mexico’s culture … he was comfortable there.'\nLew and her fiancé traveled to Canada, Las Vegas and Mexico together. They planned to visit Hawaii and backpack through Europe.\nAnthony Tsang enjoyed listening to EDM, country and indie rock music and was a Dallas basketball and football fan. He liked to draw and snowboard and loved cars, especially Porsches.\n'A couple weeks ago, we went to Porsche, and he was super excited because he got to test drive one,' Lew said. 'We went back two days later for me to test drive cars, but then he test drove it again.'\nTiana Tsang said her brother was always willing to try new things and lived a carefree life.\n'He always wanted to experience life as much as possible, and I know it sounds really cheesy, but that’s honestly just the kind of person he was,' Tiana Tsang said. 'And one thing that I really say is that, like, he really lived more life in his 23 years than some people do in their whole entire lives.'\nA version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, March 2, 2017, print edition of the Daily Nexus.\nRelated\n",

         "Credit: (photo by Keats Elliott)\nIn the photo (L-R), entertainment superstar Kim Kardashian West was on hand to kick off the second annual Children’s Hospital Los Angeles Make March Matter fundraising campaign with patients Saylor Pierson, 7, and Grace Rose, 14. The campaign aims to raise $1 million in March. (Pierson is the campaign's poster girl).\nNewswise - LOS ANGELES (March 1, 2017) – Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) launched its second annual Make March Matter™ campaign Wednesday. Longtime CHLA supporter Kim Kardashian West joined the hospital to kick off the campaign, which has attracted the commitment of more than 100 businesses in Los Angeles and the Coachella Valley. The month-long community fundraising drive is helping local businesses rally community participation to raise $1 million in the month of March to support children’s health in Los Angeles and surrounding communities.\n'Make March Matter is a movement uniting companies and individuals to bring awareness to the healthcare needs of children and to maintain the programs and services at CHLA that address those needs,' says Children’s Hospital Los Angeles president and CEO Paul Viviano. 'We are fortunate to have such a compassionate and loyal group of partners helping us to fulfill our mission of creating hope and building healthier futures for our patients and their families.'\nEach year, CHLA treats children who face a broad range of health issues, from common illnesses to traumas to chronic diseases.

Each business has selected a unique way to contribute to the campaign’s collective impact—some sell specific items with proceeds supporting CHLA patients, others devote a portion of overall sales for the entire month and still others create their own unique fundraising campaigns to galvanize their employees and consumers to contribute.\n\"Panda Restaurant Group is honored to be part of Children's Hospital Los Angeles' Make March Matter campaign again this year,\" says Calvin Lee, vice president of Operations. \"Giving is one of Panda's core values and it inspired our associates' passion to raise $350,000 to help children in need last year.

In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

        "Text"=>
         "Megan Bailey, Cranbourne Leader\nMarch 3, 2017 12:00am\nTHE Casey councillors and officers taking a trip to China next month will not be visiting giant pandas, the world’s largest shopping mall or an ancient street.\nCasey mayor Sam Aziz today hit back at criticism over the draft itinerary of next month’s seven-night trip, and said the delegation was solely to investigate investment opportunities for the city.\nThe Cranbourne Leader was given a draft itinerary listing stops for the  25,000 visit earlier this week, which included the New Century Global Centre — the world’s largest shopping centre — the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding and the Jinli Ancient Street.\nGiant Panda Research Centre\nBut Cr Aziz said today the itinerary was created by a consultant and the “real” itinerary was yet to be released.\n“Last time (in 2013) I visited four cities in five days and I didn’t even get to see the Great Wall,” Cr Aziz said.\n“The cultural visits will be to schools to develop relationships between schools and universities;  25,000 is actually quite insignificant when you consider the last trip cost  7000 and delivered  22 million in property investment in the city.”\nThe draft itinerary provoked a storm of criticism from the public, with many saying it was not the council’s place to dip its toes into foreign affairs.\nTroy Lacey said: “As a person that lives in Casey this is a ridiculous use of funds.”\n“My rates should go to improving the area, not heading to China on a holiday disguised as a business trip,” he posted.\nGeoff Hunter said: “City of Casey ... can waste  25,000 on a trip to China but they refuse to do something about the deplorable state of the unmade section of Ballarto Rd in Clyde Village where the road corrugations are so rugged and dangerous that serious damage is done to the residents’ vehicles.”\nSarah Skidmore asked: “What research have you done with businesses in our local area? You speak about the defence industry. Who deals with China in this industry? We have Federal departments that businesses deal with. I wouldn’t let the council either speak for my business or run it. This is not your role. Sam, you and the other councillors are grandstanding in areas you have no expertise.”\nAnd Michael Webster suggested: “Show him a doco on pandas, there are plenty on YouTube, and let him visit Chaddy on his lunch break. Problem solved ...”\nThe mayor’s Facebook page attracted support as well as criticism, with some praising his efforts to attract investment.\nEvelyn Gansky posted: “The greatest amount of thought, planning and vision has gone into this possible deal. You do more on a daily basis than our so-called politicians. The Casey community should be eternally grateful.”\nThe visit will also take in Shanghai, Shuanghui County in Chengdu and the Longquanyi District in Chengdu.\nThe trip was mooted two years ago and Casey Council had hoped that businesses and neighbouring Cardinia councillors would join next month’s trip but a spokesman for the Cardinia said it was unnecessary for it to spend the money.\nCasey officers said business leaders had initially been interested until the trip was scheduled for the school holidays.\nThe City of Greater Dandenong is also investigating a trip to China.\nA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

         "Smooth Operators: It’s the lifties’ mountain, they just let us ride it\nby David Stillman Meyer\n\nMarch 2, 2017\nLiftie Lingo\nThe Maze: The lines that lead up to the lift\nThe Lobster Trap: The nylon barriers that prevent runway skiers/riders as well as too much snow piling up into the maze.\nBumping a Chair: When a lift operator holds the chair back for a more gentle seating. This is only needed on the 'fixed arm' lifts.\nDetachable versus Fixed Arm Lifts: Detachable 'high-speed quads' have arms that detach from the haul rope and are guided slowly through the loading zone by tires. After loading its passengers, the spring-loaded arm reattaches to the haul rope and away it goes. Fixed-arm lifts never leave the haul rope and travel at one speed round a bull wheel at which point it smacks the back of your legs … sometimes.\nPoma: A leading chair lift manufacturer located in the Alps in France who made a number of the Skico lifts.\nChair Marking: Marking a chair to the top attendant that may require extra attention unloading.\nThe Couch: A lift on the far east side of Aspen Mountain that is a quad but is not detachable and thus not high-speed. The long, slow, often sun-soaked ride earned its nickname, The Couch.\nD.T.: Deep Temerity chairlift. The definition of \"temerity\" is excessive confidence, audacity, so someone or something with \"deep temerity\" is ... insane?\nSafety Gate: If a passenger fails to unload, their legs will contact a lightweight bar, line, or pass through a light beam which stops the lift. The lift operator will then help them disembark, reset the safety gate, and initiate the lift restart procedure.\nNumbers versus Names: On Ajax and Snowmass, lifties reference lifts by their lift numbers; Buttermilk and Highlands by their names. (Old people on Ajax refer to them by number, as well.)\nWhile each mountain in the Aspen Skiing Co. family has its unique ascent, there is something suspenseful about the trip up Aspen Highlands. The vibe at the gate on Exhibition lift this particular morning is relaxed. It's warm and sunny and The Stones are playing softly in the background. Always a brisk ride up, one sails over the treetops at 1,000 feet per minute, or 11.36 mph. The lift dumps out above the Merry-Go-Round Restaurant and after a quick skier's-right dash around the corner, one arrives at the Loge Peak lift, nestled in a wooded glade. The song \"Good Vibes\" by Rebellion reverberates loudly, courtesy of an extra speaker perched in the trees. The lift operator is grooving to the beat and the heart rate ticks up as buttocks meet chair. It's quiet again, save for the wind and the intermittent rumble of the towers before the hum of the top terminal arrives. Castle Creek sprawls out in all her glory below; the ridge of the mighty Highland Bowl looms above. Eat your hearts out, O Red Mountain overlords, these top-of-the-lift, corner-office views can't be bought.\nWe're all so concerned with going down the mountain, we often don't give much pause to the ride up — and the curious long-haired creatures who make sure we get there safely. These are the lift operators and lift attendants — or \"lifties,\" to use mountain parlance — who supply an essential service to the resort. On one hand, you could take away the instructors, the restaurants, the ticket office, even the ski patrol, and technically people could still go skiing. But with no one to run the lifts, except for maybe a few uphillers, the mountains would be empty. On the other hand, what on Earth do the lifties do all day besides press a button and watch people sit and stand?\n\"We're the most seen, least visible people on the mountain,\" explains Jesse, an Aspen native who works/DJs the No. 3 Lift (aka Ajax Express). In short, a lot is going on before the first skier/rider arrives on the hill. \"The No. 1 thing about this job is safety,\" notes Buttermilk lift manager Marianne Barrett. Mandated by the Colorado Passenger Tramway Safety Board, each lift and gondola runs through a rigorous safety protocol each morning before the lifts can operate. This includes everything from testing the phones that connects the top and bottom terminals to checking the tires on the detachable high-speed quads and running various tests on the haul rope to make sure it is performing as it should be to making sure the chairs are moving through the zones efficiently so they don't pile up (not to mention monitoring the engine, its power supply, the auxiliary diesel engine, checking the emergency brakes, gears, pulleys, belts and every detail right down to panda bear protocol — or simply keeping track of the big stuffed panda on Buttermilk and making sure it rides the lift alone; only the smaller stuffed panda is allowed to ride with the kids up the chair).\nOnce the lifts are up and running, the main job is to make sure everyone gets on and off safely. The intensity of this duty varies from lift to lift.  V.X. (aka Village Express at the bottom of Snowmass) requires no less than 10 lifties at a time to load an endless stream of beginners, whereas Five Trees at Aspen Highlands, which services AVSC, can get as few as 10 riders total. Over on the Silver Queen Gondola, the lifties are busy making sure everyone gets in and out of the cabins safely and comfortably. Maneuvering guests' skies and boards in and out of those slots is an extra little amenity the lifties are happy to do.\n'We’re the most seen, least visible people on the mountian.'\n\"I mean, we have to one-up the service from those jerks at Vail,\" one such attendant confides shortly after handing the former first lady her skis.\nBut even on the most lackadaisical of lifts, attention must never waiver for more than a few seconds at a time. One never knows when something might go wrong. Tom, who works at the top of No. 4 (aka The Big Burn at Snowmass), recently had a little girl get her skis stuck. Her parents didn't realize what happened and so he ran out to help her. She was shaken and upset, but he quickly got her all settled, gave her the traditional \"everyone falls\" pep talk, and finished the deal with a fortuitous Valentine's Day lollipop he had tucked in his parka. \"She was so glad to see me,\" Tom explains. \"People don't realize how important customer service is to this job. You can't just be some silent dude in the background. It's really important to be able to get out there and make sure the guests feel safe and have a good time.\" Or as Marianne, Buttermilk's lift manager describes it, \"You have to be personable. You have to be friendly and you can't be afraid to touch people.\"\nApart from \"touching people,\" (appropriately, of course), the other defining challenge of being a lift operator is the cold. Luckily, Aspen gets a decent amount of sunshine; however, not all lifts get sun, and obviously, it gets damn cold plenty often. On a windy, cloudy day, just try standing out there with no skiing or boarding to get your blood going for eight minutes — much less eight hours — and you can start to imagine how insidious the plunging mercury can be. Put it this way, you will be dancing a gigue faster than you can hum, \"The snow is snowing. The wind is blowing.\"\nAnd then there is the boredom. Things do get slow, which leaves plenty of time to think.\n\"Yeah, sometimes too much time,\" laughs Maestro at the Deep Temerity lift. Rex, who works top of No. 9 (aka Sheer Bliss at Snowmass) reads the papers, does the crossword, sudoku, and then throws on a podcast — or four. Light reading and distractions are OK. Burying your nose in a page-turning novel, not OK. Outside, the attendants like to hit snow around, keeping busy with whatever they can — raking, shoveling, building steps.\n\"You start to master the three-second conversation,\" explains a different Tom, who works the Scooper Lift on Snowmass.\nAnother welcome distraction is something called \"chair marking.\" When someone is particularly nervous or had a rough embarkation, the bottom attendant will call up to the top to \"mark\" the chair. They also will mark particularly creative outfits — and particularly beautiful women.\n\"It's something to look forward to,\" blushes one top operator.\nFor some, it isn't the protocols, the cold, or the occasional boredom that gets to them, it is watching people ski all day. And this is the bittersweet — borderline sadomasochistic — aspect of the job: to be totally immersed, and yet once removed, from the sport that stirs their souls. You get paid to ski 100 days a year, but for most of those days, you are only getting a single run. One liftie admits that on powder days he won't even take it. \"It's just too painful to stop.\"\nThe powder day is example perfectus of the liftie paradox. What the rest of valley looks forward to with unbridled joy, the liftie anticipates with mixed feelings. \"We joke that you learn to hate powder days,\" explains Jesse on Ajax Express. \"But it's still nice to live vicariously.\" On Ajax, it's a 6:15 a.m. call time to help get all the gondola cabs back onto the haul line. They are removed at night during heavy snowfall so they don't get too weighed down. And then there are a good two hours of shoveling, raking, clearing out the maze (the lift lines), clearing out the lobster traps (the brightly colored gates that keep people from plowing into the crowd, as well as keeps the snow from piling up inside the maze.) Then again, a lot of the lifties get to enjoy a fresh track in the morning. At the very least, a nice ride down at the end of the day, not to mention the positive energy that reverberates from the mountainsides is an intoxicating and not altogether terrible work environment.\nPerhaps the most interesting aspect of the \"liftie life\" — as it were — is the unique culture that hatches every December at the base of the lifts. What used to be a bunch of ranchers and farmers who wanted to earn some extra money during the winter has evolved over the decades to become a calling in its own right, a sort of sub-subculture of the \"ski bum,\" a collection of mostly 20-something guys and a smattering of women who each imbue their lift or gondola with its own unique charms. The lifties at Summit Express at the base of Buttermilk work under their signature disco ball, loading 4-year-olds along with X Game acrobats who have just flung themselves into the air at similar launch vectors as the private jets 1,000 yards in the distance. Over on \"the Couch,\" one of the slowest rides around, the lifties enjoy its ample sunlight and en suite grill. Over at the Cloud Nine lift, famous for the DJing as much as the lift operating, it's always a joyous affair. The energy is amplified by Cloud Nine Restaurant patrons on their way to drink and dance with abandon.\nIf there is one leitmotif to the liftie culture — besides its fondess for long, Samson-esque locks and irreverent quotes scribbled on white boards — it is the music. It's something of a late-'80s, classic rock echo chamber, a proclivity for which I was unable to source any particular rhyme or reason. The music is selected by the lifties, whoever feels like plugging in their phone, with only slight management oversight (no heavy swearing, nothing too crass or aggressive.) The music is simply what they like to listen to.\n\"My playlists happen over time,\" explains Lewis, who claims \"Planet Earth\" as home and works the Loge lift. He is particularly passionate about his tunes. Planet Earth? \"Yeah, yeah I moved around a lot growing up, but I also like that it puts everyone on the same level.\" When asked if he includes much top 40 in his playlists he winces, \"Um … no.\" His go-to genres include reggae, classic rock, funk and a bit of disco. \"The music a) keeps me going, and b) makes the guests happy.\"\nPerhaps there is no better display of liftie culture than at Customer Appreciation Day, every Wednesday on Highlands. Guests enjoy free parking, free coffee, free muffins and then at high noon precisely, the lifties at Deep Temerity serve up 80 freshly grilled hot dogs to a crowd of ravenously appreciative guests. In the eight years it has been going, four minutes is the record for selling out. The Deep Temerity lift could very well be nicknamed \"The Locals' Lift.\" Servicing the Bowl and acres of gorgeous double-diamond terrain, it's no wonder it draws a certain devout fan base. Dave, an Aspen local who moved here in 1962, has been skiing \"D.T.\" seven days a week since it opened, usually eight to 12 runs a day, depending on how many bowl laps. When asked if he skies anywhere else, he responded with zero irony, \"Sure, I skied Snowmass once this season.\"\nAlmost all the lifts have their regulars and there is a certain family vibe that is created, not only among the lifties but between the guests, as well. One passes by in but a fleeting second, but somehow that little bond can form. Which isn't to say it's all peaches and cream in the liftie world. They spend all morning getting a lift open for a powder day and then get plenty of nasty looks when the snow hasn't been swiped off the chair. Not to mention that there's a hierarchy on the mountain and the lifties are pretty much at the bottom.\n\"They assume you're a pothead, a lazy ski bum, but a lot actually goes into this job that people don't see,\" one liftie confesses.\n\"It's the lowest paid but the most essential,\" argues Jason Leadman, a lift manager at Highlands.\nSo does a passing \"thank you\" lift their spirits?\n\"I never get sick of hearing the word thank you,\" Lewis replies, \"it's always a nice thing to hear.\"\nAside from gripes about pay and a respect gap, there is an overwhelming sense of pride, responsibility and joy among the liftie set.\n\"We work for a pretty badass company. The perks are small, but good,\" admits Tom on the Big Burn.\nHis friend Rex just over on Sheer Bliss makes the obvious comparison, \"I mean, the name says it all. Great view, great commute. It's very peaceful up here.\" Granted, at that exact moment it was a whiteout and the wind was howling, but you get the point. Spending time around the lifts, watching chair after chair after chair after chair roll by like waves crashing on a snowy beach, the hypnotic, almost spiritual nature of the job starts to emerge. Indeed, there is something monastic in the life of the liftie. Accepting the position isn't quite a vow of poverty, but not terribly far off. After all, it is a life committed if not to God, than to God's country, and all its pleasures be they ripped, fermented or smoked.\nIf there is a simple \"truth\" to the liftie life it was pointed out to me by Fernanda, who is on a J-1 visa from Costa Rica and works the Village Express at Snowmass. For all the hassles and hurdles of the ski vacation, and all the sacrifices of the ski life, it all melts away the moment you rush out in between the chairs. \"Everyone is happy when they are getting on the lift,\" she observes. And that, as they say, is the truth.\nDavid Stillman Meyer is a writer and graphic designer. Reach him at stillman-meyer.com.\nJoin the Conversation\n",

         "Childrens Hospital Los Angeles Launches Second Annual #MakeMarchMatter Fundraising Campaign\nMarch 01, 2017 --\n!-- AddToAny BEGIN -->\nMore than 100 Southern California businesses will rally       individuals to raise $1 million during March in support of pediatric       care and research at CHLA\nLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Childrens       Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) launched its second annual Make       March Matter campaign Wednesday. Longtime CHLA supporter Kim       Kardashian West joined the hospital to kick off the campaign, which has       attracted the commitment of more than 100 businesses in Los Angeles and       the Coachella Valley. The month-long community fundraising drive is       helping local businesses rally community participation to raise $1       million in the month of March to support childrens health in Los       Angeles and surrounding communities.\n\n\n\n\n?Make March Matter is a movement uniting companies and individuals to       bring awareness to the healthcare needs of children and to maintain the       programs and services at CHLA that address those needs, says Childrens       Hospital Los Angeles president and CEO Paul Viviano. ?We are fortunate       to have such a compassionate and loyal group of partners helping us to       fulfill our mission of creating hope and building healthier futures for       our patients and their families.\nEach year, CHLA treats children who face a broad range of health issues,       from common illnesses to traumas to chronic diseases. The hospital is       also dedicated to innovation, supporting advances in research designed       to improve pediatric health outcomes and partnering with physicians       across the nation to bring the best care here to children in Los Angeles.\nThe hospital relies on the generosity of the community to support its       groundbreaking pediatric research and the complex care it provides for       critically ill and injured children. Last year, 67 local business and       corporate partners helped the inaugural campaign exceed its $1 million       goal, raising a total of $1.3 million to aid in funding life-saving care       for children in Los Angeles.\nHeres how the community and individuals can help Make March Matter:\nSupport the businesses that support CHLA. For a complete list of the         more than 100 participating partners and local events taking place         throughout the month of March, go to MakeMarchMatter.org .\nMake a donation at MakeMarchMatter.org .\nIndividuals may share how they are participating in the campaign on         social platforms using #MakeMarchMatter\nCorporate Partners\nCorporations across the southland have agreed to support community       members in giving back. Each business has selected a unique way to       contribute to the campaigns collective impact?some sell specific items       with proceeds supporting CHLA patients, others devote a portion of       overall sales for the entire month and still others create their own       unique fundraising campaigns to galvanize their employees and consumers       to contribute.\n\"Panda Restaurant Group is honored to be part of Children's Hospital Los       Angeles' Make March Matter campaign again this year,\" says Calvin Lee,       vice president of Operations. \"Giving is one of Panda's core values and       it inspired our associates' passion to raise $350,000 to help children       in need last year. We are committed to be the campaign's top fundraiser       again in 2017.\"\nBy visiting, shopping and dining with a business supporting       #MakeMarchMatter, individuals can activate donations to support the care       of patients at CHLA.

         "Experts raise doubts over benefit of new spillway at Hirakud Dam\nBy Express News Service   |  \n            Published:  02nd  March 2017 06:36 AM |\nLast Updated: 02nd  March 2017 06:36 AM | A+ A A- |\n0\nSAMBALPUR: Allocation of Rs 887 crore in the annual State budget for construction of an additional spillway in Hirakud dam has raised many eyebrows. This comes at a time when the State government is protesting the drastic reduction in inflow into Hirakud Dam Reservoir (HDR)  after Chhattisgarh Government constructed a series of barrages to harvest water.\nThe additional spillway at Hirakud dam was proposed after the Central Water Commission (CWC) recommended to enhance the flood water discharge capacity of all the major dams by 1.5 times of the current capacity.\nThe World Bank has even agreed to provide Rs 350 crore for the construction of the proposed spillway under the Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP).\nCurrently, there are 98 gates, including 64 sluice gates and 34 crest gates, to discharge flood water from the dam. The existing capacity to discharge the flood water from 98 gates is 15 lakh cusecs. However, it has been proposed to increase the flood water discharge capacity of the dam to 24 lakh cusecs which is why, the spillway has been proposed.\nWhile the team of Geological Survey of India (GSI) identified the location of spillway on the left dyke of the Hirakud dam, environmentalists doubt the additional spillway will be of any help.\nAccording to reports, the additional spillway is being constructed for release of flood waters from HDR. Water activist Ranjan Panda said that had the State Government planned long canals to divert water to irrigation fields or reservoirs built at a distance, it could have sold flood water to industries.\nRaising doubts over the government intention behind the spillway, Panda alleged that the State Government  is actually planning to help carry water to industries.\nHe said if the Government is serious about flood control, it should  invest in catchment protection, checking floodwaters and most importantly, increasing forest cover. \"When the State Government is unable to recover thousands of crores of water taxes and fines from defaulting industries, why should they go for World Bank loans to build such infrastructures whose impacts are doubtful,\" he questioned.\n",

         "MLAs using funds for beautification of parks: RWAs\n'Roads with potholes, dark spots, sewer system and rain drains warrant more attention'\nAnanya Panda\nTribune News Service\nNew Delhi March 1\nAlleging \"misuse\" of MLA Local Area Development (MLALAD) funds in the national Capital, Resident Welfare Associations have demanded a CBI probe into their spending by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators whom they have accused of pushing through \"wasteful\" projects in the name of beautification of parks, especially in posh colonies. Pointing out that there are areas, including roads with potholes, dark spots, sewer system and rain drains, which warrant much more attention than beautifying rich colonies they claimed most of the work is taken up as the financial year is nearing its end when the MLA funds (Rs 14 crore) if left unutilised will go waste. \"MLAs are rushing to finish their allotted Rs 14 crore each funds in unnecessary schemes and spending money in beautification of colony gates, putting up swings in rich colonies, expensive mast lights, duplicating things and putting 20 benches in small park,\" said VK Arora, convener, Delhi Residents Forum. \"Both ruling as well as opposition party MLAs are working as per their own whims, with the latter mostly appeasing the RSS dominated colonies and the former making their pockets happy,\" he alleged while adding that in all this RWAs are not kept in the loop – something that has left them disgruntled unlike during the Sheila Dikshit regime when \"bhagidari system\" allowed them some scope. \"Many are losing their playgrounds and other utility facilities due to unwanted installations and spending on things, like fixing of welcome boards, installation of mast lights at already lit areas, relaying of pavements already in good condition, putting too many benches in small parks, installing iron gates in narrow streets further narrowing entry,\" noted M M Mehra, another RWA member. Arora claimed that in East Delhi at the direction of BJP MLA O P Sharma in pavement of a park which was already in \"good condition\" was changed in Karan Vihar, a colony of 100 residents, more than 10 benches were installed in a park against wishes of colony children as installation of benches has ended their playground.\n",

         "Delhi\nPosted at: Mar 1, 2017, 12:26 AM; last updated: Mar 1, 2017, 10:57 AM (IST)\nCan’t muzzle dissent, say students\n\n NSUI members observe a one-day hunger strike against the Ramjas College row in Delhi Universitry. Tribune Photo: Mukesh Aggarwal\nAnanya Panda\nTribune News Service\nNew Delhi, February 28\nUp in arms against what they call ‘muzzling of dissent' and ‘ultra nationalism', students, alumni and teachers of Delhi University and JNU, among others, joined in large numbers the ‘Save DU' campaign called by Left-leaning student groups today. There were students from across the colleges of DU espousing the cause of the \"right to debate and dissent\" with many students arguing that the Ramjas College incident could have been an opportunity to question JNU student Umar Khalid, who is embroiled in a sedition case. \"It is (Ramjas violence and threats to Gurmehar) so scary. There is no point of having debates around democracy when there is so much intolerance. Universities have to have space for divergent views and violence is no way the answer differences in ideologies,\" said two students from Lady Shri Ram College. Losing civility is not the answer, said another protestor, even as she maintained that the fight should not be seen as one between two student factions but one against \"oppression and suppression of our right to disagree\". Another student, Kajal Bisht, who had come from South Campus, too blamed the ABVP for the entire Ramjas episode and said it must refrain from \"politics of muscle power\". Expressing solidarity to the cause, an alumna of both DU and JNU said \"The ultra nationalism that has started is horrifying. Such violence is not acceptable. What ABVP men are doing is not student politics but henchmen politics. Voices can't be throttled,\" she said. There were slogans, such as \"masculine politics not acceptable\", which echoed in the campus almost the entire day. However, the RSS-backed ABVP tried to distancing itself from the entire issue when it claimed the violence at DU's Ramjas College was provoked by \"outsiders\" whom it called \"anti-nationals\".\n",

         "Thursday, March 2, 2017\nM2M News\nChina Mobile and Ericsson delivers successful trial of world’s first cellular IoT-based connected factory\nAshish Sharma |  New Delhi |  02 Mar 2017\nChina Mobile and Ericsson share outcomes of its ongoing Connected Factory trial using Cellular IoT for Industry 4.0 working with Intel. The trial, featuring a connected screw driver among other tools, took place at Ericsson Panda Communication Company (a radio product manufacturing site and an independent subsidiary of Ericsson) in Nanjing. The outcomes of the trial are highlighted in a demonstration at Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona.\nSeveral low power, wide area (LPWA) use cases are currently being implemented in the factory, such as production line monitoring, warehouse monitoring and package and materials tracking. The centerpiece of the demonstration to be shown in Barcelona is the connected high-precision screwdriver, with motion sensors attached to NB-IoT modules that transmit real-time data of the tools to the Cellular IoT network.\nThe demonstration is an end-to-end solution, covering terminals, networks to the platform, and analytics aspects. The setup consists of Ericsson‘s multi-mode radio equipment with new software supporting NB-IoT, Intel's pre-commercial software supporting NB-IoT, the Intel XMM 7115 modem solution embedded in Fibocom's module, as well as China Mobile's OneNet IoT platform with its software development kit (SDK).\nThere are about 1000 high-precision screwdrivers in the factory which require routine calibrations and lubrications based upon the amount of usage, all of which are recorded manually on paper today. With Connected Screwdrivers, the factory will be able to replace manual tracking of the tool usage data with an automated solution. Also, by connecting the tools over the Cellular IoT network, intelligent analysis of the collected data allows for optimized maintenance. The resulting benefits include a longer lifespan of the tools and reduction of human errors during operations. Screwdrivers with motion sensors attached to NB-IoT modules means that the factory will be able to automate the usage tracking of the screwdrivers.\n\"The combination of Cellular IoT and Industry 4.0 has so far been fairly unexplored. Enabling IoT network technology such as Cellular LPWA, together with cloud-based solutions, give manufacturing firms access to more information than ever before. The opportunity to use data to increase productivity is not only beneficial to a firm, but the whole of society as well,\" said Chris Houghton, Head of Region North East Asia of Ericsson.\n\"Intel is a leading 3GPP Release 13 standardization contributor, developing a Release 13 Narrow Band IoT (i.g. CAT-NB1) based solution with the Intel XMM 7115 modem chipset. Intel will work with China Mobile and infrastructure companies to enable NB-IOT fast commercial deployment as we advance toward a 5G future,\" said Weng Kuan Tan, Vice President and General Manager of Intel's Client Computing Group China.\nChina Mobile is committed to accelerating the development of Cellular IoT technology and its ecosystem. On the one hand, China Mobile leads the incorporation and unification of NB-IoT standards by completing world's first lab testing on NB-IoT and making large-scale field trials and application exploration, in order to research   Cellular IoT networking schemes and facilitate fast maturation of end-to-end products; on the other hand, it originates the establishment of 5G Joint Innovation Center by uniting cross-industry and cross-region industry partners as well as international organizations, such as GTI and GSMA, builds open labs, makes business and  product innovation, promotes 5G networking cost reduction, and build dynamic, innovative, mutually beneficial and value sharing industry ecosystem.\n\"Ericsson is dedicated to helping operator customers around the world embrace the opportunities of IoT, 5G and Cloud. With our global leadership and experience in IoT standardization and applications, we will work hand in hand with China Mobile to realize the full potential of the Networked Society,\" added Chris Houghton.\n",

And the third time. And perhaps the fourth!\nWhen I was younger I'd make up all manner of words and sentences trying to guess what words were being sung in my favourite song and even to this day I just mime along if I'm not entirely sure.\nAccording to Genius  however, there are 10 songs that are most looked up for their lyrics in 2016, meaning that very little people to nobody at all could understand what was being sung.\nAt number 10, we have The Chainsmokers ft. Halsey's Closer which was looked up 476, 462 times.\nNumber 9 for most difficult lyrics was The Weeknd ft. Daft Punk's Starboy whose lyrics were checked 493, 697 times.\n8th place goes to twenty one pilot's Heathens with 538, 252 while 7th for most confusing lyrics lies in the hands of Drake's One Dance with a total of 563,600 views.\n19-year-old singer Desiigner holds 6th, 5th and 4th places for songs Panda, Tiimmy Turner and Panda once again.\nDrake's chorus in One Dance holds 3rd place for the chorus of his song and Desiigner holds 2nd place for the chorus of Panda too.\nAt number 1, Rihanna's Work was the most looked up song with a total of 1.3 MILLION views. According to Genius, it was words like '\nAccording to Genius, it was words like 'haffi' in Rihanna's chorus that confused so many people, causing them to check it all the time.\nRiri, I'm not always entirely sure what you're saying but you do supply us with some seriously good music.\n10\n",

         "首页 > 营销 > 5 Tips to Crack Google’s Algorithm and Drive Quality Traffic To Your Site\n5 Tips to Crack Google’s Algorithm and Drive Quality Traffic To Your Site\n原文 http://www.jeffbullas.com/2017/03/02/5-tips-crack-googles-al\n2017-03-02 06:19:47 ℃ 0 评论\nLet’s face it…\nWith over 200+ Google ranking factors making sure the law of the land prevails, and over 1 billion websites fighting for spots in search engines – if you ignore SEO, your online sales are likely to go south, especially if you are unlucky enough to get struck with a Google penalty.\nIf you do not want to fall victim to a Google penalty, ensure that whenever the Google God’s wave their magic wand and whip up an algorithm update/change, such as Penguin, Pigeon, Panda, Hummingbird, or the recent RankBrain roll out, that you comply.\nBut then again, how do online website owners actually comply when Google reveals only so much?\nEven if you keep your nose pressed against Google’s conference room, you won’t get to know much.\nSo, how do you actually entice Google’s robots to drive more traffic to your website ?\nSimple. Play Along. Learn through trial and error. Stay on the learning curve. Perhaps then, you’ll be able to differentiate what works and what doesn’t.\nHowever, if you want a shortcut, check out these 5 tried and tested tips, which ensure that Google robots play along, no matter what.\n1. Build buyer personas, then nail them with your Naturaltongue\nNaturaltongue?\nUmm… folks, if there could be Parseltongue, why not Naturaltongue, huh?\nParseltongue for snakes. Naturaltongue for Google RankBrain AI. Simple.\nBut then, what’s this Buyer Persona?\nAh, yes! That calls for some explanation!\nAccording to the Content Marketing Insitute , content marketer’s build buyer persona’s by picturising their actual customers in terms of their age, job title, the company they are working for, the challenges and frustrations they are facing every single day, in addition to whether or not they are an authority decision maker.\nOnce you have a clearer picture on who your actual audience is, start communicating with them in your natural voice.\nBuilding a target audience, bearing in mind the buyer persona, helps businesses take the bull by the horns. Put simply, it helps address the problems of your target audience, more precisely. Makes sense… nah?\nTake, for instance, a site called wickedgoodies.com . The site has on display an amazing array of cake recipes, trade show tips, cake books on Amazon, video ebooks and so much more, all focussing on cakes, in addition to some great online marketing tips.\nLooking at the site, you’d realize the owner of this site knows their online visitors thoroughly – inside out, and has optimized their website accordingly.\nSo, when a customer, say someone called Suzanne, who runs a brick and mortar cake shop, is desperately looking for some tips to accelerate her online sales and Google’s ‘ Tips to promote cake online,’   she immediately stumbles on Wicked Goodies.\nHow come, you may ask?\nIt’s partly because Google’s RankBrain immediately figures out what Suzanne really wants and the RankBrain application intelligence robots rightly interpret ‘online’ as ‘internet’, and ‘tips’ as ‘strategies,’  thus returning high-quality results for Suzanne’s long tail search query.\nRankBrain AI is programmed to give better search results for complex and long-tail searches.\nNow, Suzanne could build on this info to make sure that her brick and mortar business not only survives but gives a tough competition to its competitors.\nKey takeways\nBuild a buyer persona and narrow down your target audience by sticking to it.\nFind what’s troubling your target audience, and then address those pain points in your natural language.\nUse related keywords (mind you, not the exact keywords). This could include synonyms, and co-occurrence (more on this in a minute) while offering solutions.\nCome up with creative blogs that immediately grab your user’s attention\nDesign products and services that address customer requirements\n2. Refer to Google’s crawl error report to spot gaps\nAs it turns out, for your site to feature in top searches, Google robots need to crawl your site, first and foremost.\nBut then, there are a few things to consider to ensure that Google doesn’t miss your site, in the first place.\nFirst off, make sure you are using accurate status codes on your site.\nFor example, use 301 redirects, instead of 302 redirects. Why you may ask? Well, because a 302 redirect is not at all programmed to inform Google robots that a particular page has been moved.\nAlso, consult Google’s crawl error report. The report keeps you covered in terms of gaps in your code, which perhaps is preventing Google robots from crawling your website properly.\nPlus, you can also block certain pages from being crawled using robots.txt. As you know, every site has a crawl budget and blocking images that are not that important, which ensures you have some spare budget in hand for really important pages.\nKey takeaway:\nUse 301 redirects, instead of 302 redirects\n",

         "Adelaide Zoo's giant panda Fu Ni. Photo: AP/Adelaide Zoo/Brian Charlton\nFu Ni underwent artificial insemination in October last year, and last week her hormone levels indicated she might have been preparing to give birth.\nBut the zoo says while she went through a 'pseudo-labour' over the weekend, including contractions and heavy breathing, the time has now passed for her to have delivered a baby.\nSenior panda keeper Simone Davey says her team had been treating Fu Ni as though she was pregnant but were never able to confirm a cub.\n'During a pseudo pregnancy, hormonal changes and behaviours are identical to those of a true pregnancy, making it very difficult to determine if a giant panda is actually pregnant or not,' she said.\n'The only definitive way to confirm pregnancy in pandas is through a comprehensive ultrasound examination where a foetus can be seen in the last few weeks of a pregnancy.\n'While Fu Ni has allowed us to ultrasound her for short periods, and the ultrasounds showed some swelling of the uterus and placenta thickening, we weren’t able to confirm a foetus.'\nSince going through the pseudo labour Fu Ni has adopted a toy and spends the day cradling and holding it close to her chest.\nDavey says such behaviour is expected and keepers will continue to monitor her closely and eventually help her to move on from the toy.\nZoos SA chief executive Elaine Bensted says despite the lack of success during the most recent breeding season, officials still have hopes that Fu Ni will become a mother at some stage.\n'We have always known that breeding the Southern Hemisphere’s only giant pandas was going to be incredibly challenging,' she said.\n– AAP\nJump to next article Will my comment be published?

         "Don't miss the latest stories\nAdvertise here\nPhotographer Personifies Depression In The Most Relatable Manner\nBy Hannah Sofea , 01 Mar 2017\n\n\nWith the awareness of mental illnesses rising, there is no better way to put it than the harmony of pictures that speak more than words can convey.\n\n\n Janelia Mould-Cheeky Ingelosi  is a South African photographer whose works are mainly focused on the wonders of her mind via conceptual photography. She incorporates both nature and realism in her artworks; consistently conveying strong messages through the ethereal beauty of these two concepts.\n\n\n‘Melancholy-a girl called depression' is no different. For those who have never experienced depression, it can be an obscure feeling of dejection, yet Ingelosi perfectly captivates it with her own personification of the condition. The character in the series comes without a head, and sans arms in a few of the photographs. It depicts the feeling of hopelessness and emptiness; having almost nothing left of her to go on-explaining the reason behind the character's legs remaining attached throughout the series.\n\n\nRegardless of the hike in awareness of mental illnesses, many who suffer from it would rather hide in its shadows than to have a voice for themselves. Ingelosi is hopeful her photo series will help as a stepping stone for those who are afraid to seek help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[via  Bored Panda , images via Cheeky Ingelosi Photography ]\nReceive interesting stories like this one in your inbox\nAdvertise here\n",

         "News\nSoft-Drinks Maker Nichols Grows Annual Profit On Strong Sales Of Vimto\nLONDON (Alliance News) - Soft drinks group Nichols PLC on Thursday reported higher profit in ...\nLONDON (Alliance News) - Soft drinks group Nichols PLC on Thursday reported higher profit in 2016 thanks to good sales growth of its flagship Vimto brand.\nNichols, which also makes soft drinks such as Panda and Sunkist, said its pretax profit in 2016 grew to GBP31.5 million from GBP28.0 million in 2015, as revenue rose to GBP117.3 million from GBP109.3 million.\nNichols said it achieved growth both in the UK and internationally, with sales of its flagship Vimto brand outperforming the market at growth of 4.7%.\nThe company added that it believes it is well-positioned to \"both comply with and mitigate\" the effect of the UK government's soft drinks levy which is due to come into effect in April next year. The levy is being introduced on soft drinks which are high in sugar in order to combat the rising obesity crisis.\nNichols will pay a final dividend of 20.3 pence, up from 17.6p in 2015, giving a full-year payout of 29.3p, up from 25.6p.\n\"The group has a clear strategy for growth and whilst the soft drinks market is likely to remain challenging in 2017, the board remains confident of delivering continued success underpinned by our strong brands, diversification and successful track record of profitable growth,\" Non-Executive Chairman John Nichols said in a statement.\nShares in Nichols were trading down 1.3% at 1,665.54p on Thursday.\nBy Karolina Kaminska; karolinakaminska@alliancenews.com; @KarolinaAllNews\nCopyright 2017 Alliance News Limited.

         "68\nSHARES\nA cutting edge futuristic supercar as Saab’s comeback?\nSwedish automakers Saab have never had a proper supercar. Nowadays the company is far behind its rivals. Would a supercar make any difference? One must admit that this carmaker had some high quality and sporty models like 9-3 Viggen and Sonett but what could really bring them back on the scene with the world class automakers? It’s simple, a supercar, to be precise, one called AiroX . New Gray Design concept got us thinking because it shows AI (artificial intelligence) built into the car aside from jet-inspired, futuristic looks.\nHowever, we should take this with a grain of salt. Real chances of Saab making a supercar are really small. As the company is managed by the ‘ National Electric Vehicle Sweden ’ which puts all its focus on breathing life into the 9-3 electric model, there is not much space for a supercar project. In addition to that, the company stated in January this year that China’s ‘Panda New Energy’ ordered 15,000 electric vehicles which imply that the production of those should start at least before the end of 2017. Unfortunately, that leaves no room for a supercar, maybe it could be one of the future projects.\n68\nSHARES\n",

         "Status Update: 'April' the Giraffe Is Still Pregnant, Enjoys Yard Time With Kicking Calf\n20 to 30 million people across the globe have tuned in to watch a live stream of her late-stage pregnancy\nSTATUS CHECK: You Can See the Kicks in April's Belly! \n\nThe 15-year-old giraffe named \"April,\" who has captivated millions of people across the world as they watch a live stream in anxious anticipation of the birth of her fourth calf at an upstate New York zoo, is still pregnant and doing well.\nNY Zoo Giraffe Stream Banned for 'Nudity' Back After Outcry\nVeterinarians with the Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, outside Binghamton, said April is experiencing increased belly movement. The happy and healthy mother-to-be has also started to produce milk and shed a few droplets during a Saturday evening examination.\nThe spotted beauty gazed into the camera, wiggling her ears as she chewed her breakfast Sunday morning. The zoo said the giraffes will stay inside due to the extreme temperature drop and wet or frozen conditions.\n\"Rest assured, they receive extra enrichment and extra attention on days they do not venture out,\" the zoo said. \"A little extra bonding time!\"\nShe and her mate, 5-year-old Oliver, had to be separated from each other while they frolicked outside Saturday afternoon because he got aggressive and wanted to rough house. According to vets, bullish behavior is common for male giraffes during the final stages of pregnancy.\nUS-Born Panda Bao Bao Lands in China After Leaving DC Zoo\n\"He does not want to play house -- he wants to ROUGH house,\" the park wrote in a Facebook post Saturday morning. \"That is natural behavior as males take no part in rearing their young, nor have a need for a female once she is pregnant. Sad but true.\"\nViewers were concerned about the long-necked lovers' separation and questioned the vet's intentions until the zoo offered reassurance and told animal lovers to trust them.\nNot much changed as the day came to a close: April alternated between standing still, swinging her tail, drinking water and slowly circling her pen. At one point during the afternoon, the calf could be seen kicking around in her belly.\nApril's pregnancy was catapulted into global headlines earlier Thursday after YouTube briefly yanked the zoo's live stream following complaints by animal activists that it violated the site's policies concerning \"nudity and sexual content.\" Thousands upon thousands of commenters voiced their frustration on Facebook and YouTube, and the stream was restored within an hour or so.\nAn Egg Has Landed! Eagle Cam Shows Egg in Nest at National Arboretum\nMore than 30 million people across the globe have tuned in over the last few days to watch it. You can check out the live stream above.\nApril was seen slinking gracefully around her hay-laden home Friday morning in no apparent distress. Once she goes into active labor, zoo officials say the keepers will go in to help her but the first-time dad will be held out of the pen. Active labo\nSpecial Delivery: Bao Bao Gets Ready for Flight to China\nGiraffe pregnancies last for 15 months. Labor lasts anywhere from a few hours to a few days. The calf will be about 150 pounds and 6 feet tall at birth and up and walking in about an hour. The zoo says it will hold a contest to name it.\nPublished at 8:50 AM EST on Feb 26, 2017 | Updated at 10:02 AM EST on Mar 2, 2017\n",

The young pandas are almost seven months old, but despite their impressive climbing skills, the twin cubs were not allowed out into the open until now. A large number of journalists and visitors greeted the animals on their outing, making sure that their first adventure outside would be memorable. Their mother Yang Yang watched on closely as her cubs attempted to climb to the highest points of the outdoor enclosure. After the three-hour walkabout, the zoo keepers picked Fu Feng and Fu Ban up and brought them back inside their compound.

         "Video | Featured Videos\nTwo Panda Cubs Take First Trip Outside their Vienna Zoo Compound 1:12\nTwin panda cubs Fu Feng and Fu Ban went on their first walk outside of their indoor enclosure at Vienna's Schoenbrunn Zoo on Tuesday and made their first appearance to the adoring public. The young pandas are almost seven months old, but despite their impressive climbing skills, the twin cubs were not allowed out into the open until now. A large number of journalists and visitors greeted the animals on their outing, making sure that their first adventure outside would be memorable. Their mother Yang Yang watched on closely as her cubs attempted to climb to the highest points of the outdoor enclosure. After the three-hour walkabout, the zoo keepers picked Fu Feng and Fu Ban up and brought them back inside their compound. The baby pandas will get some much needed rest before exploring their compound once more.\nMarch 3rd 2017\n4 hours ago\n/video/video.news.com.au/News/\n",

The Toronto Zoo says attendance is up for the first time in several years, which it attributes to a baby animal boom and good weather. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young\nTORONTO — The Toronto Zoo is citing a baby animal boom as one of the main reasons for its first attendance increase in several years.\nIn an annual review presented to its board, the city-owned facility said more than 1.3 million people visited the zoo in 2016, an increase of nearly 170,000 people compared to those who came to the zoo the previous year.\n\"It was a very good year,\" said zoo spokeswoman Jennifer Tracey.\nAttendance had been declining at the zoo since 2013, when the facility had seen a boost due to the arrival of two pandas from China.\nFor 2016, the zoo cited several cubs — two pandas, four white lions and a polar bear — along with a rhinoceros calf as among main reasons for its attendance bump.\nThe new panda cubs, named Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue, even drew Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other politicians for a cuddle session at the zoo last spring.\nAccording to results of the zoo's 2016 on-site visitor survey, 37.7 per cent of respondents said they visited the facility because of the panda exhibit, 31 per cent said they went explicitly to see the panda cubs and a further 17 per cent said baby animals in general drew them there. The remaining respondents said they visited the zoo for other attractions.\nBabies weren't the only reason for the boost in attendance.\n\"The weather is also a huge factor,\" Tracey said. \"We had great fall weather.\"\nThe zoo had its third-highest October attendance since it opened in 1974 when 93,145 people visited, according to the report. And the following month was its best November on record when 46,638 came out.\nTracey said a hot, dry summer also had an impact.\n\"Rain, or even the threat of rain will make people change their plans for the day,\" she said.\nAs it plans for the year ahead, the zoo noted that many of its popular baby animals are leaving the facility after growing up.\nThe panda cubs, as well as the adult pandas, are scheduled to leave for the Calgary Zoo in March 2018, the white lion cubs have already left for a park in Quebec and Juno, the now-large polar bear, just left for Winnipeg's Assiniboine Park on Wednesday, Tracey said.\nSo the zoo is looking at the possibility of more babies.\n\"I am hopeful that there will be success with conservation breeding programs this year,\" Tracey said.\nShe also touted the upcoming opening of its \"Wildlife Health Centre\" that is scheduled to open some time this spring.\n\"There will be a public viewing area into some of the labs where they can see our reproductive technologists at work, x-rays, surgical suites and where they run a lot of the lab work,\" Tracey said.\nThe 2016 attendance boost led to increased revenues at the zoo, Tracey said, but the facility still needed a City of Toronto subsidy to balance the books.\nBy Liam Casey, The Canadian Press\n",

The Harpursville zoo said that April hasn't changed much physically but that there has been \"significant movement once again in the belly.\"\nApril and Oliver: Love Story Behind Famous Giraffe's Pregnancy\nA cold front moving into the northeast on Thursday and the zoo suggested this might \"shake things up.\" Other than the belly movement, April's keeper and vet also documented \"increased tail raising and holding,\" as well as \"periods of increased movement/pace\" Wednesday night.\nHer condition was pretty much unchanged Thursday morning, the zoo said, adding that there was \"a lot of behavior that had us on our toes but no acknowledgeable active labor at this time.\"\nOver the last week, April has captivated tens of millions of people across the world who have been checking in on her via the live stream in anticipation of the birth of her fourth calf.\nSome 60,000 people were tuned in to the stream at the crack of dawn Thursday. The graceful giraffe appeared calm and collected as she picked at stray pieces of hay and stretched around to scratch a back itch. Watch it above.\nNY Zoo Giraffe Stream Banned for 'Nudity' Back After Outcry\nThe zoo, which unveiled April-inspired emojis and t-shirts as the fan base for the 15-year-old long-necked beauty continues to swell, said twin Barbados lambs and a Patagonian Cavy were born early Wednesday.\n\"Babies babies everywhere!\" the Animal Adventure Park posted Wednesday morning. \"Just not yet in the giraffe barn.\"\nApril's pregnancy was catapulted into global headlines last week after YouTube briefly yanked the zoo's live stream following complaints by animal activists that it violated the site's policies concerning \"nudity and sexual content.\" Thousands upon thousands of commenters voiced their frustration on Facebook and YouTube, and the stream was restored within an hour or so.\nGiraffe pregnancies last for 15 months. Labor lasts anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Once April goes into active labor, zookeepers will go in to help her the rest of the way. The calf will be about 150 pounds and 6 feet tall at birth and up and walking in about an hour.\nUS-Born Panda Bao Bao Lands in China After Leaving DC Zoo\nThe zoo said it will hold an online competition to name the baby giraffe once it's born.\nPublished at 7:52 AM EST on Mar 2, 2017 | Updated 6 hours ago\n",

         "TR EMERITUS\nThe Voice of Singaporeans for Singapore\nSending younger ministers to China to build relationships?\nDPM Teo Chee Hean said that Singapore purposely sent younger ministers for the recent delegation to China as a forward-looking move to build relationships that our founding fathers had helped build with China.\nI think this is just another excuse. The delegation was more Singapore's show of backing down after the recent issues with China, where some of our Ministers started slamming China's foreign policy, and China retaliated by their show of strength. These young ministers probably sent there to be taught who is the boss in this region, if by any chance they start to forget and think they can have their own way with other countries like how they have they own way with their own citizens.\nAnyways, this is a working trip for the ministers. Now, when someone goes on working trips, they better bring back some good business. So, this is the same for the Ministers. Don't just go there for holiday, better bring back China investments to Singapore. Just like what Malaysia and Philippine leaders achieved when they visited China. Your pay are many times higher than theirs. Time to work hard.\nAL Goh\n4 Responses to \"Sending younger ministers to China to build relationships?\"\nJim:\nYoung pigs send to the lion den to taste real life and be slaughtered as a sacrificial piglet\nGD Star Rating\nloading...\nLIONS:\nwell,vb FUMBLED YET AGAIN,he remained so quiet.\n\nwe need a more well-received FM to improve our image with the outside world.\nbtw,TEO CHEE HEAN'S ANCESTORS from OCBC linkage had good ties with CHINA n OCBC OPERATES IN CHINA for many years.\nso,seems the right bloke to send to appease the angry PANDA.\nTHEY BETTER SALVAGE THE RELATIONSHIP or we all kena marked???\n",

         "Patricia Escarcega\nChino Bandido and Chop and Wok Serve Nontraditional Asian Fare — With Mixed Results\nThursday, March 2, 2017 at 7 a.m.\nBy Patricia Escarcega\nEXPAND\nA combo meal at Chino Bandido can include elements of a number of global cuisines.\nJackie Mercandetti\nDoes Chino Bandido have the weirdest menu in town? Possibly. It's hard to think of another local restaurant where you can order an egg foo yung burrito, pair a chile relleno with your pork fried rice, or get a rice bowl topped with both Sonoran machaca and Chinese barbecue.\nThe Mex-Chinese (with a dash of Caribbean flavor) restaurant debuted in 1990 in north Phoenix, a sort of forerunner to the kind of modern fusion cooking you now find at places like SumoMaya or the Clever Koi. Chino Bandido doesn't so much fuse distinct cuisines together, though - more like plops them side-by-side in the same aluminum bowl.\nThe restaurant has been around long enough to achieve cult-classic status in metro Phoenix. It's the restaurant equivalent of that quirky indie movie you love fiercely and remember fondly, but which might not be recommended for a mass audience, or perhaps doesn't have the same impact on a second viewing.\nStill, there is something eternal about eating at Chino Bandido, a feeling that's kind of evoked in the restaurant's tagline - \"Eat at Chinos, Live Forever!\"\nThe restaurant's mascot, a panda bear with a Pancho Villa-inspired canana (cartridge belt) slung across its chest, wearing a big sombrero and holding chopsticks, seems so curiously retro and cheesy, it feels about ready to be embraced as a local icon. You can picture the logo splashed across the front of some Phoenix hipster's faded vintage-style T-shirt.\nThe veggie quesadilla at Chino Bandido was decidedly underwhelming.\nJackie Mercandetti\nThe strip-mall restaurant itself is shabby yet appealing. The restaurant's lobby, decked out with black-and-white checkered floors and a \"Wall of Chino\" covered in plaques and award certificates bearing dates from nearly 20 years ago, seems untouched by time. You get the feeling that some of the friendly people working the counter have been there about that long, too.\nIf you grew up in north Phoenix, the bare-bones dining room, which has been expanded over the years to seat more than 100 guests on workaday folding tables, probably holds as many memories as any scrapbook.\nFor first-timers, the Chino Bandido menu - printed on long, white order forms with instructions and checkboxes - might seem about as complicated and indecipherable as somebody's medical chart. It's full of obscure acronyms - the JFR stands for jerk fried rice - and painfully obvious menu descriptions: Quesadillas, in case you haven't figured it out yet, are \"folded cheese crisps.\"\nOne of the best things about eating at Chino Bandido is simply figuring out the ordering system. The combos and configurations are almost endless, and you can get as weird with your order as you wish. You can order some Mexican-style carnitas, served over Jamaican jerk fried rice, with a cheese quesadilla on the side. Nobody will bat an eye.\nYou probably love the food at Chino Bandido's more than I do. On a recent visit, my combo bowl was a cheese-laden muddle of bland refried beans, under-seasoned pork fried rice, and an egg foo yung that was so devoid of flavor, it might have doubled as a waterlogged dishrag.\nAn order of the T.J. Veggie quesadilla was not much more than a soggy flour tortilla, half-heartedly sprinkled with a little cheese and crammed with cold iceberg lettuce and veggies.\nThe real allure comes with the proteins, unapologetically made in the vein of American Chinese fast food - things like the Jade Red chicken, Chinese barbecue pork, or Hengrenade chicken. You can sample the various meats before locking in your order at the counter.\nOne of the best items at Chino Bandido is the complimentary snickerdoodle cookie.\nJackie Mercandetti\nOn a recent visit, the Jade Red chicken yielded soft, fleshy bundles of meat, draped in a goopy, sodium-rich sauce. The Chinese barbecue pork had a sort of earthy richness, like a loose, vaguely sweet mole sauce.\nThe chewy texture of the meat, though, and the unnaturally goopy flavorings, may siphon away some of the joy of eating at Chino Bandido.\nThe most perfect thing I've ever eaten at Chino Bandido, as it happens, is not something smothered in an orange-reddish sauce. It's the complimentary house snickerdoodle cookie that comes with your meal. It's a light, sugary confection that seems like an odd way to wind down dinner, until you remember that you are at Chino Bandido, where anything goes.\nIf Chino Bandido doesn't satisfy your yen for Chinese takeout, another unusual spot for old-school American Chinese food is Chop and Wok, a fraying-around-the-edges, rock 'n' roll-themed haunt near Shea Boulevard and Scottsdale Road.\nEXPAND\nThe potstickers at Chop and Wok.\n",

         "NetEase Games Conducts Its First Ever Developers Forum in the West\n2017-03-02 03:10\nGUANGZHOU, China and SAN FRANCISCO, Mar. 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- NetEase Games today held its first ever developers forum in the West, titled \"Insight of Fun\", in San Francisco . Living up to the company's motto of \"good games have no borders\", lead developers of NetEase's five flagship games shared development concepts and behind-the-scene stories with an audience of gamers, industry peers, and reporters. The successful event was a direct reflection of the popularity and traction that NetEase Games has in overseas markets.\nThe Insight of Fun forum focused on NetEase Games' core value - committed pursuit of the highest quality games and player experience. The company's mission is for gamers, developers and others who are involved in the gaming ecosystem to explore and enjoy the fun of games. Going forward, NetEase Games will host regular events in overseas markets to share development experience with industry peers and to explore the globalized future of gaming.\n\"Quality games have no borders. At NetEase, it is our sincere hope to create more high quality and innovative products for gamers around the world,\" said Ethan Wang , V ice President of NetEase, Inc.\nAttendees also got a preview of NetEase Games' global product plan. \"This Spring, we will be launching a deep and immersive 3D-action MMORPG,\" said Riten Huang , General Manager of NetEase Games. \"Following that, we are excited to bring the popular game, Onmyoji, to audiences in the West. Later in 2017, we also plan to launch a strategy and exploration MMO game created by an international team of developers, including top industry talent s from China , the United States , Germany and South Korea .\"\nRobust financial and operational performance in China forms a solid foundation for NetEase's overseas expansion. In 2016, revenues of NetEase's online gaming segment reached $4 billion , up 61.6% year over year. NetEase Games continues to maintain high growth rate and deliver new hit games. After consolidating its market leadership in China , NetEase Games is looking to expand further overseas. When discussing the overseas strategy for NetEase Games, NetEase CEO Ding Lei mentioned that he has ambitious goals to achieve greater results in the non-Chinese gaming markets within the next three to five years.\nTo show their dedication toward overseas markets, NetEase sent its dream team of lead developers for five flagship games to the event. This group consisted of Chen Junxiong of the mobile version of the NetEase classic Fantasy Westward Journey, Jin Tao of 2016 blockbuster Onmyoji, Yu Kai of the company's first virtual reality game Twilight Pioneers, Liu Xi of the mobile game adaptation of Hollywood animation film Kung Fu Panda 3, and Wang Xi of the upcoming 3D warfare MMO War Rage.\nThese five developers represent NetEase Games' flagship titles and the highest quality of production that the company intends to bring to overseas markets. Early indications of global expansion have been very encouraging - Fantasy Westward Journey has over 100 million registered players worldwide; Twilight Pioneers was selected as among the first wave of releases on Google's virtual reality platform Daydream; Kung Fu Panda 3 was rated Google Play 2016 Top 10 Games in Korea; the Japanese version of Onmyoji was released last week and was number on the free download rankings. Unlike the others, however, War Rage was designed for overseas markets from the ground up.\nBy harnessing its industry leading game development capabilities and unique insight into fun, NetEase will propel its global expansion by introducing Chinese games to global markets, working with partners to publish titles in China , and create games developed from the ground up tailored to international audiences. Many exciting changes are ahead, but what remains is the company's commitment to creating the best games for players in China and around the world.\nAbout NetEase\nNetEase, Inc . i s a leading internet technology company in China .

         "What you need to know about the Arnold Sports Festival\nThursday\nMar 2, 2017 at 5:37 AM Mar 2, 2017 at 11:38 AM\nAlissa Widman Neese The Columbus Dispatch   @AlissaWidman\nGet pumped. The Arnold Sports Festival and Fitness Expo kicks off today.\nAn estimated 200,000 fitness enthusiasts, athletes, sports fans and spectators are expected to flock Downtown to the annual event named after one of the world's best-known bodybuilders, Arnold Schwarzenegger. \nHere are eight things you need to know to get ready for the big weekend:\n 1. What is it?\nThe Arnold Sports Festival is the largest multi-sport festival in the nation — even bigger than the Olympics — with about 20,000 athletes from 80 nations competing in 70 sports and events. The Expo will feature more than 1,000 booths of the latest in sports equipment, apparel and nutrition among competition stages. Most events are Friday-Sunday at the Greater Columbus Convention Center and the Ohio Expo Center.\n2. When did it start?\nSchwarzenegger and sports promoter Jim Lorimer have co-produced the U.S. festival in Columbus since 1989, when it debuted as a one-day bodybuilding competition known as the Arnold Classic. They now host multi-sport festivals on five other continents: Australia, South America, Africa, Asia and Europe.\n3. How much does it cost?\nA daily Expo ticket is $15 in advance and $20 at the door, which offers admission into the Arnold Fitness Expo and most other events. A three-day ticket is $40 in advance. Children 14 and under are free with an adult. Buy tickets and admission to other special events at ticketmaster.com/arnold.\n4. How do I get there?\nFree shuttles will connect every Downtown hotel to the Greater Columbus Convention Center for most of the weekend. A shuttle from there heads to the Ohio Expo Center. (View a shuttle map and schedule.) The Columbus Commons parking garages should have spaces available and guests can reserve other parking spots online ahead of time through Parking Panda.\n5. What's new?\nNew events in 2017 include lacrosse, disabled power-lifting, yoga classes and competitions, handball, the Arnold Pro Strongwoman, Indoor Scottish Highland Games and the Arnold Transformation Challenge. That's in addition to the iconic bodybuilding competitions and sporting events and everything in-between.\n6. Is it kid-friendly?\nChildren are encouraged to come to the Ohio Expo Center's Bricker Building for the Arnold Sports World Kids & Teens Expo on Saturday and Sunday. It's a smorgasbord of interactive sport demonstrations and activities with more than 200 vendors, zip-lining and a stage with nonstop entertainment.\n7. Will Arnold be there?\nOf course! Though it's possible to spot Schwarzenegger maneuvering through throngs of people throughout the weekend (just look for the swarming fans) he'll make some public appearances to present awards and take photos, too. His Sunday showcase from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Batelle Grand is the only opportunity to engage with him in an open forum. Tickets cost $25.\n8. Where can I learn more?\nCheck Dispatch.com all weekend for coverage of competitions, athlete profiles and feature stories about new events. Visit arnoldsportsfestival.com and follow the Arnold on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n",

(Oct. 13) \n\nAttendance had been declining since 2013, when the zoo had seen a boost due to the arrival of two pandas from China.\nTracey says a warm fall, a dry summer and a moderate spring also helped the numbers for 2016.\nShe says the attendance bump led to increased revenues\n",

Lofty realizes that his eagerness to do too much on his own caused the problem, and that working as a team with Tiny is much better. \n* While clearing trash from Fixham Beach, Lofty collects all of the driftwood he can find. Scoop is baffled that Lofty thinks the driftwood is beautiful and tries to throw it all away. When Muck hauls the debris to the dump, Lofty spots a prize piece of wood, and grabs it, causing the trash to fall back into the water! With creative problem-solving and teamwork, Bob uses the driftwood to create a floating barrier in order to collect the flotsam and jetsam. Later they use the driftwood to decorate the path to the beach. Even Scoop is impressed. duration 28:55 STEREO TVY (Secondary audio: DVI)\n1:30 pm\nWordWorld [#205] Get Well Soon Soup/Mmm-Mmm-Milk!

Last month, a roulette player from the UK had a €565,034 a winning streak at the Roulette Professional Series table. Before him, Royal Panda Casino announced the big live blackjack win of 30-year-old Michael from the Netherlands.\nMichael was playing at the Exclusive Royal Panda Live Blackjack VIP table, betting up to €5,000 per one hand. Such high bets insist that Michael is a high roller who’s confident in his blackjack strategy. Following a streak of big winning hands, Michael left the table with €71,250. What’s more, he also collected plenty of Royal Panda Casino loyalty points.\nThe popular UK gambling site has a slightly different loyalty reward-system than most casinos. The points you collect can be exchanged for bonuses as well as gifts such as gadgets, including iPad, iPhones, and MacBooks. A €50 bet on live blackjack translates to 1 loyalty point, so Michael probably finished his session with hundreds of loyalty points.\nScore the next big live blackjack win\nIf you’d like to score a similarly big live blackjack win, take a seat at one of Royal Panda Casino’s live blackjack tables.

The young pandas are almost seven months old, but despite their impressive climbing skills, the twin cubs were not allowed out into the open until now. A large number of journalists and visitors greeted the animals on their outing, making sure that their first adventure outside would be memorable. Their mother Yang Yang watched on closely as her cubs attempted to climb to the highest points of the outdoor enclosure. After the three-hour walkabout, the zoo keepers picked Fu Feng and Fu Ban up and brought them back inside their compound. The baby pandas will get some much needed rest before exploring their compound once more.\nMarch 3rd 2017\n2 hours ago\n/video/video.news.com.au/News/\nVideo\n",

However, the girl decided to move out the relationship after coming to know that the actor was married. While Anupam reportedly assured the complainant to marry her after divorcing his wife, the latter was in no mood to mend the ties and go ahead with it.\nFollowing the breakup, the duped girl then distanced herself from Panda which he couldn’t take it. Enraged over this, he allegedly circulated their intimate photographs on social networking site and sent it to her family members. Besides, he also allegedly intimidated her.\nFollowing this, the girl studying MBA in a city-based institution filed a complaint with the local police station here leading to his arrest.\nNotably, Anupam Panda had played the lead character in ‘Flashback’ released in December 2015.\nThe regional entertainment industry has been embroiled in various controversies including casting couch and involvement in chit fund scam.\n",

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young\nTORONTO — The Toronto Zoo says attendance is up for the first time in several years, which it attributes to a baby animal boom and good weather.\nThe park says more than 1.3 million people visited the zoo in 2016, an increase of nearly 170,000 people compared to those who came to the zoo the previous year.\nZoo spokeswoman Jennifer Tracey says the births of two pandas, four white lion cubs and a rhinoceros calf are the main reasons for the attendance bump.\nAttendance had been declining since 2013, when the zoo had seen a boost due to the arrival of two pandas from China.\nTracey says a warm fall, a dry summer and a moderate spring also helped the numbers for 2016.\nShe says the attendance bump led to increased revenues.\nBy The Canadian Press\n",

         "Netflix goes offline with its new feature that allows members to download their favorite TV series and movies to their devices. Televisione Streaming / Flickr\nWhat is your style of winding down after a particularly difficult day at work? Some of us might choose to head down to the local watering hole and have a pint or two while exchanging banter with our mates. Others prefer to just sit down, kick back their shoes and relax on their favorite sofa while turning the TV on. There are so many things to watch on TV these days, where do you start? Well, we can tell you one thing -- you would not go too far wrong if you are a Netflix customer. March madness is coming your way, and in a good manner too -- there are new Netflix movies and TV shows to enjoy. Without much further ado, here are the details on what is in store for the month of March on Netflix.\n\nIron Fist and The Discovery\n The two heavyweights that will make u p the bulk of Netflix originals would be Iron Fist and The Discovery for the month of March. The maiden season of the Marvel series Iron Fist will make its debut this coming March 17, where it will be yet another Marvel character who have made the transition to the small screen such as Daredevil, Jessica Jones and Luke Cage . Expect The Defenders to arrive once the entire Iron Fist series is shown, as that would then bring together all of the superheroes into the same team -- a budget Avengers, if you will.\n\nAs for The Discovery, this happens to be a brand new Netflix original movie that will see Jason Segel, Rooney Mara and Robert Redford star. The Discovery is titled that way, as it will concentrate on the discovery (duh!) of an afterlife, which eventually translates to millions of suicides as well as dealing with the fallout that happens after that.\n\nThere are also other noteworthy original titles from Netflix that will arrive this month, including the first season of 13 Reasons Why, the second season of Love, the second season of Grace and Frankie, as well as the Amy Schumer comedy special that is aptly titled, Amy Schumer: The Leather Special.\n\nHere are the titles that are available since March 1, 2017:\n\nAngry Birds: Season 2 (2013)\n Blazing Saddles (1974)\n Chicago (2002)\n Deep Run (2015)\n Dirt Every Day: Season 1 (2013)\n Epic Drives: Season 2 (2015)\n Friday After Next (2002)\n Head 2 Head: Season 2 (2013)\n Hot Rod Unlimited: Season 1 (2013)\n Ignition: Season 1 (2013)\n Impossible Dreamers (2017)\n Jurassic Park (1993)\n Jurassic Park III (2001)\n Kate and Mim-Mim: Season 2 (2015)\n Know Your Enemy – Japan (1945)\n Kung Fu Panda (2008)\n Let There Be Light (1946)\n Memento (2000)\n Midnight in Paris (2011)\n Nacho Libre (2006)\n Nazi Concentration Camps (1945)\n Roadkill: Season 2 (2013)\n Rolling Stones: Crossfire Hurricane (2012)\n San Pietro (1945)\n Singing with angels (2016)\n Sustainable (2016)\n Slums of Beverly Hills (1998)\n The Craft (1996)\n This Is Spinal Tap (1984)\n Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny (2006)\n The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)\n The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress (1944)\n The Negro Soldier (1944)\n Thunderbolt (1947)\n Tunisian Victory (1944)\n\nMarch 3, 2017\n Greenleaf: Season 1 (2016)\n\nMarch 4, 2017\n Safe Haven (2013)\n\nMarch 5, 2017\n Señora Acero: Season 3 (2016)\n\nMarch 7, 2017\n Amy Schumer: The Leather Special-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\nMarch 8, 2017\n Hands of Stone (2016)\n The Waterboy (1998)\n\nMarch 9, 2017\n Thithi (2015)\n\nMarch 10, 2017\n Buddy Thunderstruck: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Burning Sands-NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n Love: Season 2-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n One More Time: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n The Boss' Daughter (2016)\n\nMarch 13, 2017\n Must Love Dogs (2005)\n Million Dollar Baby (2004)\n\nMarch 14, 2017\n Disney's Pete's Dragon (2016)\n Jim Norton: Mouthful of Shame-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\nMarch 15, 2017\n Disney's The BFG (2016)\n Notes on Blindness (2016)\n\nMarch 16, 2017\n Beau Sejour: Season 1 –NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Coraline (2009)\n\nMarch 17\n Deidra & Laney Rob a Train-NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n Julie's Greenroom: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Marvel's Iron Fist: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Naledi: A Baby Elephant's Tale (2016)\n Pandora-NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n Samurai Gourmet: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\nMarch 18, 2017\n Come and Find Me (2016)\n The Vampire Diaries: Season 8 (2016)\n\nMarch 20, 2017\n El Reemplazante: Season 1-2 (2012)\n\nMarch 21, 2017\n Ali & Nino (2016)\n Another Forever (2016)\n Evolution (2015)\n Fire at the Sea (Fuocoammare) (2016)\n\nMarch 23, 2017\n How to Get Away with Murder: Season 3 (2016)\n Welcome to New York (2015)\n\nMarch 24, 2017\n Bottersnikes & Gumbles: Season 2-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Déjà Vu (2006)\n Felipe Neto: My Life Makes No Sense-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Grace and Frankie: Season 3-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Ingobernable: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Spider (2007)\n The Square (2008)\n The Most Hated Woman in America-NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)\n\nMarch 25, 2017\n The Student Body (2017)\n USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage (2016)\n\nMarch 26, 2017\n The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004)\n\nMarch 27, 2017\n Better Call Saul: Season 2\n\nMarch 28, 2017\n Archer: Season 7 (2016)\n Jo Koy: Live from Seattle-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\nMarch 30, 2017\n Life in Pieces: Season 1 (2015)\n\nMarch 31, 2017\n 13 Reasons Why: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Bordertown: Season 1-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n Cooper Barrett's Guide to Surviving Life: Season 1 (2016)\n Dinotrux: Season 4-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n FirstBorn (2016)\n Five Came Back-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n GLOW: The Story of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (2012)\n Rosewood: Season 1\n The Carmichael Show: Season 1-2\n The Discovery-NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n Trailer Park Boys: Season 11-NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\n",

         "news.com.au — Australia’s #1 news site\nVideo\nTwo Panda Cubs Take First Trip Outside their Vienna Zoo Compound 1:12\nTwin panda cubs Fu Feng and Fu Ban went on their first walk outside of their indoor enclosure at Vienna's Schoenbrunn Zoo on Tuesday and made their first appearance to the adoring public. The young pandas are almost seven months old, but despite their impressive climbing skills, the twin cubs were not allowed out into the open until now. A large number of journalists and visitors greeted the animals on their outing, making sure that their first adventure outside would be memorable. Their mother Yang Yang watched on closely as her cubs attempted to climb to the highest points of the outdoor enclosure. After the three-hour walkabout, the zoo keepers picked Fu Feng and Fu Ban up and brought them back inside their compound. The baby pandas will get some much needed rest before exploring their compound once more.\nMarch 3rd 2017\nan hour ago\n/video/video.news.com.au/News/\n",

         "Top hedge fund Python coder talks open source burnout\nby Sarah Butcher About an hour ago\nAre you killing yourself with your side projects on Github?\nhttp://news.efinancialcareers.com/us-en/274030/top-coder-hedge-fund/\nYou've finished the day job, time for the unpaid side project\nIf you're a Python coder who wants to work for a hedge fund and you don't know Wes McKinney, you might want to familiarize yourself with the name. McKinney started working for Two Sigma, the huge quant hedge fund with around $40bn under management, in August 2016. He's best known, however, in the world of open source programming.\nAn MIT math graduate, McKinney began his finance career at hedge fund AQR Capital Management in 2007. Three years later, he quit to do a PhD at Duke. Since then, he's been steeped in the world of Python data analytics tools, including Datapad, a visual analytics system he sold in 2014, and the open source Pandas Python data analysis library,  which is nine years old this April.\n\"Open source is the future of how a lot of our software will get built,\" said McKinney, speaking at a Newsweek conference on artificial intelligence and data science in London today. However, because open source software is typically developed by engineers working on unpaid side projects, he said many open source initiatives are unsustainable and can absorb all engineers' free time. Open source programmers, \"have lives and families,\" said McKinney, adding that he personally has started limiting his involvement for this reason. \"I personally feel that if my open source work isn't being sponsored, I ought to focus on things that can pay my rent.\"\nMcKinney didn't say so, but this might be why he joined Two Sigma, which pays an average of $417k to each of its staff in London.  Two Sigma, along with rival quant fund Man AHL, is one of the pioneers in the use of open source code in trading applications. \"The best way for finance to contribute to open source is to dedicate engineering time at the organization to allow open source projects to survive,\" McKinney said. This way, open source coders will get paid for their passion.\nFor this to happen, however, finance needs to open up. Ever-secretive, financial services firms have traditionally been mistrustful of the open-source communities where everything is shared by definition. This is changing, but only on the periphery. Gary Collier, co-chief technology officer at hedge fund Man AHL, said AHL doesn't use open source code for the proprietary algorithms in its trading systems, but for the \"building blocks\".  Airflow, a tool developed by Airbnb, is being trialled as a scheduling device by the fund, for example.\nAs hedge funds wake up to the importance of open source, involvement in communities like Github is a valuable source of CV points for potential recruits. \"If you want to recruit top talent into an organization, the organization needs to get into open source,\" says Collier. Equally, candidates need to show evidence of involvement in open source projects. \"If you're a techie, you need to be on Github,\" says another senior hedge fund technologist. \"It's like being an artist or an architect  you need your side projects, you need to point people towards your portfolio.\"\nThis is all well and good, except developing your open source portfolio takes time. And as McKinney points out, time is short when you've got a day job and family to consider. It's even worse if your open source project takes off. In this case, McKinney said you can become \"overburdened with success.\" For example, his Panda system  which has 9,000 stars on Github  reached a point where it required so much maintenance and stabilization time that he had little time for innovation or anything else. \"It becomes a full time job,\" said McKinney. \"Which is difficult when people are working on these things on a voluntary basis.\"\nRelated articles:\nHedge fund's top 24 year-old coder shares his secrets\n",

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young\nTORONTO — The Toronto Zoo says attendance is up for the first time in several years, which it attributes to a baby animal boom and good weather.\nThe park says more than 1.3 million people visited the zoo in 2016, an increase of nearly 170,000 people compared to those who came to the zoo the previous year.\nZoo spokeswoman Jennifer Tracey says the births of two pandas, four white lion cubs and a rhinoceros calf are the main reasons for the attendance bump.\nAttendance had been declining since 2013, when the zoo had seen a boost due to the arrival of two pandas from China.\nTracey says a warm fall, a dry summer and a moderate spring also helped the numbers for 2016.\nShe says the attendance bump led to increased revenues.\nBy The Canadian Press\n",

         "What FY results mean for Nichols plc and Spirent Communications plc\nNichols. Fair use.\nKevin Godbold | Thursday, 2nd March, 2017 | More on: NICL SPT\nShares have been moving up lately in Spirent Communications (LSE: SPT) the provider of test methodologies and solutions for data communications and in Nichols (LSE: NICL) the soft drinks manufacturer. So, is there anything in today’s full-year results from these firms to halt the momentum or does progress look set to continue?\nAll looking good\nHeadline figures for Nichols include revenue up 7.4% compared to a year ago, an operating profit rise of 9% and adjusted earnings per share ticking 9.7% higher. That all looks good, but the best figure of all is the directors’ hiking of the full-year dividend by 15.3%. I think that move speaks volumes about the how they see the health of the business and its prospects.\nAfter reflecting on \"another very good year\", non-executive chairman John Nichols said he expects the firm’s clear strategy for growth to overcome challenging soft drinks markets during 2017. His confidence is underpinned by the company’s strong brands, diversification and successful track record of growth.\nThose all-important brands include names such as Vimto, Panda, Sunkist, Levi Roots and Feel Good Drinks. As well as diversity of brands, the firm has sales diversified across markets with Vimto, for example, selling in more than 85 countries. Meanwhile, its track record of growth speaks for itself.\nYear to December\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\nOperating cash flow per share (p)\n34.8\n",

         "NBH managing director hints that FX issue would be unfavourable - paper\n\n\nBudapest, February 16, 2017 (MTI-ECONEWS) - National Bank of Hungary managing director Daniel Palotai suggested Hungary would be better off financing its debt with forint, rather than FX, issues this year in an interview published in Thursday's issue of business daily Vilaggazdasag.\n\n\n\"Naturally, a decision on the financing structure [of Hungary's state debt] is the responsibility of the debt manager. We just wanted to call attention to the fact that if one looks not just at nominal interest rates, but at all costs involved [in FX issues] as well as exchange rate risks, forint financing is more advantageous at present than FX financing,\" Mr Palotai told the paper.\n\n\n\"The NBH does not want to have a say in debt management, rather it wants to support a reduction in the country's vulnerability,\" he added, noting steps the central bank has taken to boost demand for forint government securities.\n\n\n\"We can finance ourselves from internal sources and in forints. That's why we believe that a strategy built on the foundation of forint financing continues to be achievable, and more advantageous,\" he said, adding that the NBH also sees further opportunity to move in the direction of securities with longer maturities.\n\n\nMr Palotai said that the issue of a low-volume onshore \"panda\" yuan-bond would be \"favourable\" as it could \"support geographical diversification\" and \"serve economic diplomacy goals\".\n\n\nNational Economy Minister Mihaly Varga said late last year that the government plans FX issues of EUR 1.2bn in 2017, but the volume could vary depending on market possibilities. Hungary could tap euro, USD, yuan or yen bond markets, he added.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n        \nBack to the list\n\n\n",

         "Editions:\nFunk Fest 8 rocks into Punta Gorda\nBY BOB MASSEY\nbmassey@floridaweekly.com\nHere Come the Mummies rock it out at Funk Fest 7. ALEX ARATARI / FLORIDA WEEKLY\nBring on da noise! Bring on da funk! Bring on Punta Gorda's favorite festival to get down and shake, rattle and roll.\nYes, Funk Fest 8 makes its crashes into City Marketplace on March 3 and 4, featuring its eternal headliners - the macabre musicians whose identities remain under wraps, Here Come the Mummies, along with 14 other bands exciting enough to tighten the Sphinx's sphincter.\nIn 2016, Funk Fest evolved for the first time from a one- to two-day extravaganza, with stupendous results.\n\"Last year we had about 3,000 or 4,000 people,\" said Nick Nemec, who organizes the event along with his father, Matt Nemec. \"This year, we hope it's going to be larger than that. Primarily the people who come to this are from outside of the area, and we're pretty proud of that. But we created it for our locals, so we use Punta Gorda in the name.\"\nBig Sam's Funky Nation. COURTESY PHOTOS\nThe Nemecs - who own Big Crush Distribution - are not only the founders of Funk Fest, but also the Big Orange Music Fest that debuted in September. They seem to have a knack for establishing successful events, which apparently includes a willingness to change things up, as they'll be doing with this year's Funk Fest.\n\"The whole thing essentially is going to be different,\" Mr. Nemec said. \"The actual property itself - the way Funk Fest is set - is going to be turned around and moved all around. It's going to give us a lot more festival space than last year. It's going to definitely let everyone spread their wings a little bit and enjoy the property more.\"\nThis year, he promises to have more than 15 vendors in the \"indie\" market, which will have merchants offering a variety of goods from hammocks to tie-dyed clothing to jewelry. Added to the mix will be a professional glass-blower who will creating and selling pieces on site, and a speed painter who will not only offer small-canvas pictures but will also be working on a mural that will progress through the duration of the festival.\nBob White, Mummy Rah and Lori White.\nOther additions include: general admission seating that's 30 feet closer to the stage, a larger second stage, craft beers and boutique wines offered to both VIP and general admission ticketholders and a food truck village.\nIf putting together Funk Fest sounds like a lot of work, it is.\n\"Funk Fest 7 last year was March 4 and 5,\" Mr. Nemec said. \"I think we started on Funk Fest 8 on March 9 and 10. We gave ourselves a couple of days' reprieve, and then started hitting it up and trying to get the acts put together. It takes a full year to put together the event now.\"\nTim Reynolds & TR3\nAs with previous years, the musical acts will perform on two stages, trading off so that when one band finishes on one stage, the next band begins on another.\nThe reason band selection begins a year in advance is because, (1) there are 15 of them, and (2) attendees of past festivals make suggestions on other bands they'd like to hear. The Nemecs also target their own favorites that they feel are a good fit - including the perennial appearance of Here Come the Mummies.\n\"This year, we have the world-famous Neville family (Dumpstaphunk, led by Ivan Neville, son of singer Aaron Neville) headlining on Saturday,\" Mr. Nemec said. \"We have Jim Reynolds, the lead guitarist for the Dave Matthews Band. They're going to be headlining on Friday night. Then there's Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad, which is No. 1 on the Billboard chart for reggae. The list goes on. It's pretty incredible the lineup this year.\"\nGiant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad\nThe Motet, from Colorado, is the biggest festival band right now on the circuit, he added.\n\"The Motet is really one of the sleeper bands that people around here might not know, but they're really well known on the West Coast of the United States. They're going to be a band that will leave your mouth wide open, and you're going to want more. They are high energy, high octane, with amazing musicianship.\"\nThe only tickets left to Funk Fest 8 are general admissions seats. The \"exclusive\" weekend pass tickets - selling at a whopping $1,500 a pop - sold out two months ago. The $130 \"premier\" were nearly gone before the end of February. And it would surprise no one if this year's crowds exceed 4,000. Why not?\n\"This is an all-day, all-weekend music festival that never stops,\" Mr. Nemec said. \"The music is going to be world class, mostly in the funk genre but also a lot of jazz and rock and even some country infusion. It's a little bit for everybody. I don't think anyone would come and say they didn't like the music.\n\"And it's not just music - it's art. It's a lifestyle. It's great cocktails, craft beers, food. It's going to encompass a lot of cool things.\" ¦\n>> What: Funk Fest 8\n>> When: 3:30 p.m. to midnight Friday, March 3;1:30 p.m. to midnight Saturday, March 4\n>> Where: Punta Gorda City Marketplace, across from River City Grill\n>> Cost: Advance tickets: $50 for both days, $25 for Friday only, $35 for Saturday only.\n>> Tickets and information: www.Funk- FestPuntaGorda.com\n\n\n\n",

The child had otitis due to improper bathing. According to Eurostat data, with an infant mortality rate of 8.4 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2014, Romania ranks first among European countries (the EU rate is 3.7). Gangiova, Romania, Aug. 18, 2016.\n'Good day, doctor! Good evening, doctor', voices of people of all ages greet her kindly as Floarea Ciupitu walks around the village. At 61 she has been a family doctor serving Gangiova, a village in south-west Romania for the past three decades. Ciupitu oversees roughly 1700 registered patients. On week days she sleeps above her practice in a tiny room, on an old hospital bed. At night, a tiny flashlight guides her way one store up to her modest accommodation, no electricity on the staircase. Romania has a population of almost 20 million. Doctors in rural areas are outnumbered by peers in cities two to one, while half of the population lives in the countryside. The healthcare sector is overrun with crises and never ending problems. In 27 years since the anticommunist revolution of 1989 the country has had at least 25 health ministers take office. Doctors, especially younger ones, are fleeing the country in search of better work conditions and career opportunities. The Romanian Health Ministry states there is a severe doctors shortage. While things may look a little better in the city, Romania's villages are plagued with a lack of access to healthcare. Family doctors are often overworked having to care for a larger number of patients than the recommended average. Ciupitu is living proof that, despite all the difficulties and the problems in a flawed system, there still are doctors who commit to their patients. She stands to help remember that being a doctor is a calling.\n© Asger Ladefoged\nWhat happens, when 28 schoolchildren meet the controversial Danish therapist Carl-Mar Møller and are encouraged to play freely without rules? A sixth grade class from Øster Farimagsgade, a School in Copenhagen has done it twice. They went from the posh part of central Copenhagen to muddy wildness in Kokkedal, Denmark. There is only one rule at Carl-Mar Møllers place: No shoes inside. So nobody interfered with the pillowfight in the dormitory. Everything was in play and all involved left the fight exhausted and smiling.\n© Frederik Buyckx\nThere is a peculiar transformation of nature when winter comes, when snow and ice start to dominate the landscape and when humans and animals have to deal with the extreme weather.

They have studied, trained and grown up here.\n© Eduard Korniyenko\nIn the Soviet era, the sport of bodybuilding was not welcomed by official institutions, as opposed to weight lifting, which was judged acceptable and included in the Olympic program. But people everywhere, from small towns in the far North-East to Siberia, Moscow and even the foot of the Caucasus Mountains, persisted in going to the \"sweat box\" gyms in cellars, to \"build a body.\" Western magazines crammed with images of unrealistically muscled male and female bodies passed from hand to hand and an additional impetus to this semi-legal sport came with the growth of Arnold Schwarzenegger's popularity. Today, with the ban lifted, bodybuilding’s popularity has not diminished. The only difference is that some of the clubs have moved from their old basements into modern fitness centres, although the basement scene remains. A couple of times a year the participants climb the podium during various amateur and even professional tournaments. Here you can meet anyone; tax inspectors and businessmen, housewives and popular TV presenters. Regardless of social status, or whether you live in a small town in the centre of Siberia, or in a big city, the only important thing for these people is making their bodies look perfect, and being admired by others.\n© Mahesh Shantaram\nAnywhere in the world, it takes a black person to tell us what racism really feels like. On January 31st, 2016, India woke up to yet another news of a shocking mob attack against a Tanzanian student. This particular one was appalling enough to earn international press and force the nation into a period of soul-searching. Since the incident, I've been traveling across the country to meet Africans and learn about their experiences. I make portraits as a personal response to give them recognition. Hamza came all the way from Nigeria to study human rights in India. This I found surprising. I didn't know one could study that subject here except perhaps to study its spectacular absence. Hamza is by far the most sensitive guy I've ever met on this tour of Africans in India. When I asked to photograph him in his wallpapered dwelling, he requested that he be joined by his love, Shukura, a student of nursing. He says of this relationship, \"Thank you for being patient with me. Together we can prove those bitches wrong.\"\n© Dario Mitidieri\nMarch 2017 will mark the sixth anniversary of the beginning of the war in Syria. More than 470,000 people have died since. In all, 11.5% of the country’s population have either been killed or injured. 45% of the population have been displaced, 6.36 million internally and 4.8 million abroad. This is the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era.  Lost Family Portraits aims to tell the story of those who have lost family members in the Syrian war, and who have made their way to the refugee camps in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. The empty chairs or spaces in the photographs symbolize the missing family members. Lost Families Portraits is a reminder of the of the destructive power that war has over families. It is also a testimony to the 1.5 million refugees who are left behind in Lebanon, who cannot afford to buy their way into Europe and who have nothing to go back to.\nOWAYED'S FAMILY - \"I was forced to leave my 4 sons behind.

It’s hard to imagine, but these animals, who roamed the earth for eight million years, were only discovered in the last century. Unknown, and hidden from the western world for millions of years, even today they are seen by few but known by most everyone. Found only in central China, the entire species came dangerously close to extinction. Scientists considered the giant panda a relic species; shy, and difficult to breed in captivity. But now there is a glimmer of hope, as years of research are finally paying off. In a region where bad environmental news is common, China cracked the code and is on its way to successfully saving its most famous ambassador.

Demonstrating a free use of the language of visual forms, it appears like a game, similar to Goldbach's conjecture; the destruction of the ossified template of the city, a visual exploration of breaking the rules. In a spatial context, when we ignore the aesthetics of the city, ignore the rules and celebrate the deconstruction and reconstruction of the urban space, the space itself gives us more control and adds more joy to the city.\n© Diego Mayon\nProstitution is legal in Greece and the authorities decided to stipulate that all brothels must have permits.

The adult webcam industry is worth $1 billion annually, and is growing fast as the technology becomes better and cheaper.  Collectively, the sites are estimated to be visited daily by some 5 percent of the web's global users and the number of models performing live online shows from private apartments or from specialized studios is increasing worldwide. Romania, a country with one of the highest rates of youth unemployment in the EU, is now the undisputed world capital of studio-based cam operations, thanks to widespread wireless broadband access. The industry has grown substantially since 2001, and most major Romanian cities now count hundreds of facilities offering English-speaking male and female models—most in their twenties—fast internet connections, high definition webcams and decorated rooms where they can turn into the virtual best friends and cybersex partners of paying clients, mostly from North America, but also from European and Asian countries. In exchange for the workspace, the studios take a percentage of the models’ pay—which can reach $48,000 per month. The models are paid by platforms like Luxembourg-based LiveJasmine, one of the leading providers, ranking as the 103rd most popular site in the world and, with 25 million unique visitors monthly, the 80th most visited site in the USA.\n© Tasneem Alsultan\n\"I married my dental college classmate.

Until then, my step brother decides on my behalf.\"\nWhilst Saudi Arabia is an international symbol of Islam, many Saudis would agree that there's a strong disconnect between the Qur'an and local traditions. I wanted to answer question that many shared: Do we need marriage to signify that we have love? Do you need a husband to have a significant life? I started the project thinking I only had my personal story to share. I was married at the age of 17, and living separately as a single parent for the last six years of an unhappy 10 year marriage. Many family members commented on how foolish I was to ask for a divorce. Only later, I realized that there were many Saudi women who had similar experiences, beyond my expectations of a typical Saudi housewife. With each story, I found more women sharing complex marriage theories and experiences. I followed the stories of widows, happily married, and divorced women. I explored the concept of love, photographing my young daughter and grandmother. Utilizing imagery (with permission from those weddings I photographed) I interlaced the construction and expectation of marriage through often elaborate wedding ceremony imagery and rituals. A common realization with every woman I photographed, was that they all managed to overcome the many hurdles that was put by society or/ and state.\n© Li Song\nIn November 2016, Li Hang, an eleven-year-old boy from Harbin, arrived at Changchun weight loss centre determined to lose weight. He had been diagnosed with Prader-Willi Syndrome when he was 3 years old, and on admission, his weight had reached 155 kilograms. Prader-Willi Syndrome is a disease related to an abnormality in chromosome 15, and in around 70% of patients is inherited from their father. It occurs in 1 in 15000 people.  Li Hang was being treated with traditional Chinese medicine every day, including massage, acupuncture, fire treatment and cupping therapy. Fire treatment is a weight loss treatment. Ingredients are applied to the body’s meridian system, with the fire process unblocking meridian points that hinder the speed of the body’s metabolic processes, all with the aim of transforming fat into energy that can be eliminated from the body. From his initial fear to this point, Li Hang has been greatly tormented, but he is supported by his faith in doing what is necessary to live a normal person’s life and to look after his mother.\n© Amber Bracken\nOceti Sakowin, or the Seven Council Fires, is the true name of the great Sioux nation and refers to the coming together of the different factions of the tribe.  Oglala, Cheyenne, Ut, Cree, Hopi and non-indigenous all are among the 200+ tribes represented in the camps and on the front lines. The last time there was a similar gathering was before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, 1876. For nearly ten months, members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and their allies have been camped in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing their land and water. The estimated $3.78 bill project is nearly complete, crossing almost 1,172 miles. But the resistance has stalled development at the Missouri River. Although on it's face, the issue is the pipeline, the conflict runs much deeper and is steeped in generations of violent history. These are the people of the Battle of Little Big Horn and of Wounded Knee, who were driven to starvation by the loss of the buffalo and away from their sacred Black Hills. Police treatment of water protectors hasn't been out of step with this history. In military vehicles and body armor, police have indiscriminately used tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, percussion grenades and water canons in sub-zero temperature. Despite all of this, the pipeline is still unresolved and water protectors are still on the land. But wether the pipeline is completed or not, the groundswell created for this resistance will certainly have reverberations for industry and indigenous people alike.

Many have already made the harrowing decision to flee their homes, in some cases leaving behind the bodies of loved ones who died as the fighting came to their area and had to be buried in front gardens.\n© Yulia Grigoryants\nLusine with her children in their tiny apartment in Gyumri, sleeping all 6 in the only room, that serves also as kitchen and playroom for the family. In 1988, a 7.0 Richter-scale earthquake struck northern Armenia. The quake killed at least 25,000 people in the region. Thousands more were maimed and hundreds of thousands left homeless. Gyumri, Armenia’s second largest city bore much of the damage. Large-scale war by the early 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union, an energy shortage, and a blockade that left landlocked Armenia with just two open borders contributed to exacerbating the region's already prevalent social and economic problems. A quarter of a century later, Gyumri has the country’s highest poverty rate at 47.7%. The city has lost nearly half of its population since 1988, due in part to the migration of the labor force. A few thousand families are still living in makeshift shelters, waiting for help. Many of them are not eligible for new housing, since they are not considered to be direct victims of the earthquake. 25 years later, they are still waiting for urgently needed improvements to their dwellings. During the Soviet era, these huge twin dormitory buildings on the outskirts of Gyumri accommodated around 60 families each. Today there are just four families living here, among decaying walls and corridors.\n© Sandra Hoyn\nKajol with her 6-month-old baby Mehedi and a customer on her bed. Two weeks after birth of Mehedi she was forced to have sex again with customers. Because of the baby her business is not good. The Kandapara brothel in the district of Tangail is the oldest and one of the largest in Bangladesh - it has existed for some 200 years. It was demolished in 2014 but has been re-established with the help of local NGOs. The brothel district is surrounded by a two-meter wall, and in the narrow streets within, there are food stalls, tea shops and street vendors. More than 700 sex workers live and work here with their children and their madams. Many of the women were either trafficked or born inside the brothel's walls and in this way their livelihood is secure. Their customers are policemen, politicians, farmers, fishermen, factory workers and groups of teenage boys.\n© Michael Tummings\nHidden captures man’s engagement with nature through a close examination of the practice of hunting. Hunting lies at the foundation of human survival. These unflinching photographs capture the human element in the ritualized killing of animals. Their focus is on authentic, observed moments that have been shaped by tradition, and which are still practiced in the modern world. Increasingly, our access to nature is designated as a cultural activity. Nature functions as construct of the imagination, where it is romanticized as pure and harmonious. But nature itself is marked by decay and violence. While hunting posits man as an external source of violence, the culling of animals maintains the balance and diversity of the landscape – even as it domesticates the landscape into an elaborate garden. These photographs reference the classic European tradition of paintings depicting the hunt, in addition to 20th century photographic portraiture. The rituals and divisions of class are inherent to the images in Hidden, as are both the modernization and preservation of tradition. Employing 5 x 4 analogue photography, the series uses a detached camera eye to observe the social dynamics of the group, its rituals, and the ways in which they are infused with meaning.\n© Nader Saadallah\nQuarries’ Men is a portfolio about white limestone quarries craft in Minya, Egypt and how are the workers can make and shape these Stone from the white mountain. There are four phases. The first is the equalization of mountain with a big winches and spikes. The second phase is the shaping, there's a machine which called \"El fasalah\" which cut and partition the mountain to stone blocks \" 13*26 cm\" . The third phase is the extracting, there's a machine which called \"El hashasha \" which extract the final result of the stones as a free blocks that ready to use, The fourth and final one is the filling, after that the workers are filling it into the vehicles to be ready for trading in the market.\n",

         "First timer's guide to the National Cherry Blossom Festival\n0\nShayla Martin\nFor the AJC\n10:30 a.m. Thursday, March 2, 2017 Atlanta Life\n0\nThe true sign that spring has sprung in Washington, D.C., is the bloom of thousands of cherry trees sprinkled across the National Mall . A gift from Japan in 1912, the 3,020 trees were planted around the Tidal Basin and East Potomac Park.\n» RELATED: 10 can't-miss spring festivals in metro Atlanta \n\nThe cascade of blooms inspired a three-week festival, drawing more than 1.5 million visitors to Washington each year. The 2017 National Cherry Blossom Festival takes place from March 15 until April 16, with peak bloom (the day when 70 percent of the trees around the Tidal Basin have opened their buds) predicted for March 14 to 17. The festival is filled with a variety of signature events, including Opening Ceremony on March 25 at Warner Theater, the Blossom Kite Festival on April 1 and the National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade on April 8.\n» RELATED: How to get tickets for the national African American history museum \n\nTrip tips\nA trip to the nation's capital for the National Cherry Blossom Festival is an item on many bucket lists, but navigating the city when it swells with fellow tourists can be overwhelming. Narrowing down what to pack, where to spot the blooms, where to stay and where to park is no small task.\nAlthough items like great walking shoes and a camera are a must, there are a few other things you'll want to toss in your suitcase. The pollen count surges during peak bloom, so bring Claritin or any other non-drowsy allergy medicine if you have pollen allergies, along with extra tissues and eye drops. Non-perishable snacks like trail mix and dried fruit are also good to have on hand since prices at food carts and stands along the National Mall go up during the festival.\nTo see the flowers and avoid major crowds, take a self-guided tour of the United States National Arboretum , home to 76 varieties of cherry trees. Cherry blooms are also found in Anacostia Park along the Anacostia River; the Japanese-style garden at Hillwood Estate, Museum & Gardens ; Rock Creek Park and Tudor Place in Georgetown.\n» RELATED: Wildly popular Yayoi Kusama ‘Infinity Mirrors' exhibit coming to Atlanta's High Museum \n\nWhere to stay\nCherry blossom fever takes over nearly every aspect of the city, reflected by special hotel packages and menu items at area restaurants and bars. Make memories at Capella Washington, D.C., Georgetown , where the Cherry Blossom Bloom package combines a full breakfast and accommodations in a superior room, with a private Segway tour through downtown and a professional photography session among cherry blooms. The hotel will bid farewell with your framed photography upon checkout. The Drink in the Blossoms Package at The Donovan gifts guests with two cocktails from hotel restaurant Zentan , two sachets of Organic Cherry Blossom Rose tea and a postcard featuring artwork inspired by the cherry blossoms from local artist Jamie Langhoff. Finally, families will love a stay at Avenue Suites Georgetown , where each suite has a fully-equipped kitchen, allowing guests to take advantage of the property's Stock The Fridge program with Trader Joe's. Not one to miss out on cherry blossom fun, the Your Avenue to the Cherry Blossoms package includes a personalized walking map of the Tidal Basin, guaranteed parking and a complimentary drink at the on-site A Bar lounge.\nGetting around\nFinding parking is notoriously difficult in Washington, so take the efficient and comprehensive Metrorail system. If your trip is three days or more, leave your car overnight in the daily parking lot at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and take the metro (located within the airport) to downtown. Metro Center, Federal Triangle, Smithsonian, Archives and L'Enfant Plaza stops all are within walking distance from the Tidal Basin cherry trees.\nIf driving is a must, there are free parking spaces on the National Mall along Madison and Jefferson Drives near the Smithsonian Museum, and a free parking lot at East Potomac Park, but spots fill quickly. Additionally, free on-street parking is available throughout downtown but generally restricted to two hours. Apps like SpotHero and Parking Panda , and BestParking.com allow users to find a parking space, compare rates and reserve a space at a discounted price. At all costs, avoid parking at a hotel, where rates are much higher than public lots, and office building garages.\nGetting there\nWashington, D.C., is serviced by three major area airports: Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA); Dulles International Airport (IAD); and Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Airport (BWI). DCA is the only airport directly connected to the Metrorail system via the yellow and blue lines, but IAD and BWI Airport are accessible via Metrobus and Metrorail. Various flight carriers offer nonstop flights to all three airports from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.\nFor more information on the National Cherry Blossom Festival, visit www.nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/ and for more information about Washington, D.C., visit washington.org/ .\nThis story has been updated to reflect the 2017 National Cherry Blossom Festival.

         "Editions:\nFunk Fest 8\n... rocks into Punta Gorda\nBY BOB MASSEY\nbmassey@floridaweekly.com\nHere Come the Mummies rock it out at Funk Fest 7. ALEX ARATARI / FLORIDA WEEKLY\nBring on da noise! Bring on da funk! Bring on Punta Gorda’s favorite festival to get down and shake, rattle and roll.\nYes, Funk Fest 8 makes its crashes into City Marketplace on March 3 and 4, featuring its eternal headliners — the macabre musicians whose identities remain under wraps, Here Come the Mummies, along with 14 other bands exciting enough to tighten the Sphinx’s sphincter.\nIn 2016, Funk Fest evolved for the first time from a one- to two-day extravaganza, with stupendous results.\n'Last year we had about 3,000 or 4,000 people,' said Nick Nemec, who organizes the event along with his father, Matt Nemec. 'This year, we hope it’s going to be larger than that. Primarily the people who come to this are from outside of the area, and we’re pretty proud of that. But we created it for our locals, so we use Punta Gorda in the name.'\nBig Sam's Funky Nation COURTESY PHOTOS\nThe Nemecs — who own Big Crush Distribution — are not only the founders of Funk Fest, but also the Big Orange Music Fest that debuted in September. They seem to have a knack for establishing successful events, which apparently includes a willingness to change things up, as they’ll be doing with this year’s Funk Fest.\n'The whole thing essentially is going to be different,' Mr. Nemec said. 'The actual property itself — the way Funk Fest is set — is going to be turned around and moved all around. It’s going to give us a lot more festival space than last year. It’s going to definitely let everyone spread their wings a little bit and enjoy the property more.'\nTim Reynolds & TR3\nThis year, he promises to have more than 15 vendors in the 'indie' market, which will have merchants offering a variety of goods from hammocks to tied-yed clothing to jewelry. Added to the mix will be a professional glass-blower who will creating and selling pieces on site, and a speed painter who will not only offer small-canvas pictures but will also be working on a mural that will progress through the duration of the festival.\nTim Reynolds & TR3\nOther additions include: general admission seating that’s 30 feet closer to the stage, a larger second stage, craft beers and boutique wines offered to both VIP and general admission ticketholders and a food truck village.\nIf putting together Funk Fest sounds like a lot of work, it is.\n'Funk Fest 7 last year was March 4 and 5,' Mr. Nemec said. 'I think we started on Funk Fest 8 on March 9 and 10. We gave ourselves a couple of days’ reprieve, and then started hitting it up and trying to get the acts put together. It takes a full year to put together the event now.'\nGiant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad\nAs with previous years, the musical acts will perform on two stages, trading off so that when one band finishes on one stage, the next band begins on another.\nThe reason band selection begins a year in advance is because, (1) there are 15 of them, and (2) attendees of past festivals make suggestions on other bands they’d like to hear. The Nemecs also target their own favorites that they feel are a good fit — including the perennial appearance of Here Come the Mummies.\n'This year, we have the world-famous Neville family (Dumpstaphunk, led by Ivan Neville, son of singer Aaron Neville) headlining on Saturday,' Mr. Nemec said. 'We have Jim Reynolds, the lead guitarist for the Dave Matthews Band. They’re going to be headlining on Friday night. Then there’s Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad, which is No. 1 on the Billboard chart for reggae. The list goes on. It’s pretty incredible the lineup this year.'\nMummy Rah shows off his soul to Bob White and Lori White at Funk Fest 7 last year.\nThe Motet, from Colorado, is the biggest festival band right now on the circuit, he added.\n'The Motet is really one of the sleeper bands that people around here might not know, but they’re really well known on the West Coast of the United States. They’re going to be a band that will leave your mouth wide open, and you’re going to want more. They are high energy, high octane, with amazing musicianship.'\nThe only tickets left to Funk Fest 8 are general admissions seats. The 'exclusive' weekend pass tickets — selling at a whopping $1,500 a pop — sold out two months ago. The $130 'premier' were nearly gone before the end of February. And it would surprise no one if this year’s crowds exceed 4,000. Why not?\nTara Nemec, Ashley Shaffer and Ginny Cormeny felt so good at Funk Fest 7.\n'This is an all-day, all-weekend music festival that never stops,' Mr. Nemec said. 'The music is going to be world class, mostly in the funk genre but also a lot of jazz and rock and even some country infusion. It’s a little bit for everybody. I don’t think anyone would come and say they didn’t like the music.\n'And it’s not just music — it’s art. It’s a lifestyle. It’s great cocktails, craft beers, food. It’s going to encompass a lot of cool things.' ¦\n>> What: Funk Fest 8\n>> When: 3:30 p.m. to midnight Friday, March\n3;1:30 p.m. to midnight Saturday, March 4\n>> Where: Punta Gorda City Marketplace,\nacross from River City Grill\n>> Cost: Advance tickets: $50 for both days,\n$25 for Friday only, $35 for Saturday only.\n>> Tickets and information: www.FunkFestPuntaGorda.com\nDumpstaphunk\n\n\n\n",

         "Fu Ni had zoo staff in a flap over a pregnancy that never happened. Photo: Zoos SA Adrian Mann\nAdelaide Zoo has confirmed its female giant panda Fu Ni was not pregnant over the last few months despite her behaviour strongly suggesting she was experiencing labour.\nIt was the zoo's third attempt at helping the panda and her mate, Wang Wang, become parents as mature adults and increase the species' population, which currently stands at less than 1900 in the wild.\nFu Ni has adopted a toy that she has been cradling and holding close to her chest since the false alarm.\nZoos SA senior panda keeper Simone Davey said the zoo had artificially inseminated panda Fu Ni twice in October.\nShe said hormonal changes and changes in her uterus had given them hope Fu Ni had become pregnant.\nRelated Coverage\nMs Davey said Fu Ni experienced contractions and heavy breathing over the weekend that were consistent and common for pandas going into pseudo labour.\n\"It's like a learning curve or a training mechanism for giant pandas, so they have less mismothering the first time round,\" she said.\n\"It gives them the experience to become better mothers when they are actually pregnant.\"\nMs Davey explained the large ratio difference in size between mother and foetus meant ultrasounds could not detect a cub until the last two weeks of pregnancy, which gave the keepers hope that her behaviour meant she was going into labour.\nShe said Fu Ni had experienced re-absorption, which is when all the remnants of a foetus in a failed pregnancy are absorbed back into the body, following past inseminations.\nIt meant there were no physical signs of that pregnancy having taking place.\nThis year, however, progress was made as Fu Ni went into the next stage of pseudo pregnancy, giving Zoos SA staff hope of more success in the next breeding season.\n\"This year also was the first time we saw all these other behaviours like the false labour so we've actually got new information that we haven't seen before that will help us a lot in the future,\" Ms Davey said.\nWang Wang and Fu Ni are the only giant pandas in the southern hemisphere and were given to Adelaide Zoo at young ages so they could naturally adapt to the environment.\n\"Because we are the guinea pigs, it is a unique experience. Hopefully this breeding season we'll see some more improvements,\" Ms Davey said.\nOn previous occasions of pseudo pregnancy, Fu Ni's tendency to rub herself on objects had been considered a nesting behaviour (see gif below).\nhttp://1v1d1e1lmiki1lgcvx32p49h8fe.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AliveCheeryAstrangiacoral.webm\n-ABC\n",

The Harpursville zoo said that April hasn't changed much physically but that there has been \"significant movement once again in the belly.\"\nApril and Oliver: Love Story Behind Famous Giraffe's Pregnancy\nA cold front moves into the northeast on Thursday and the zoo suggested this might \"shake things up.\" Other than the belly movement, April's keeper and vet also documented \"increased tail raising and holding,\" as well as \"periods of increased movement/pace\" Wednesday night.\nOver the last week, April has captivated tens of millions of people across the world who have been checking in on her via the live stream in anticipation of the birth of her fourth calf.\nSome 60,000 people were tuned in to the stream at the crack of dawn Thursday. The graceful giraffe appeared calm and collected as she picked at stray pieces of hay and stretched around to scratch a back itch. Watch it above.\nThe zoo, which unveiled April-inspired emojis and t-shirts as the fan base for the 15-year-old long-necked beauty continues to swell, said twin Barbados lambs and a Patagonian Cavy were born early Wednesday.\nNY Zoo Giraffe Stream Banned for 'Nudity' Back After Outcry\n\"Babies babies everywhere!\" the Animal Adventure Park posted Wednesday morning. \"Just not yet in the giraffe barn.\"\nApril's pregnancy was catapulted into global headlines last week after YouTube briefly yanked the zoo's live stream following complaints by animal activists that it violated the site's policies concerning \"nudity and sexual content.\" Thousands upon thousands of commenters voiced their frustration on Facebook and YouTube, and the stream was restored within an hour or so.\nGiraffe pregnancies last for 15 months. Labor lasts anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Once April goes into active labor, zookeepers will go in to help her the rest of the way. The calf will be about 150 pounds and 6 feet tall at birth and up and walking in about an hour.\nThe zoo said it will hold an online competition to name the baby giraffe once it's born.\nUS-Born Panda Bao Bao Lands in China After Leaving DC Zoo\nPublished 4 hours ago | Updated 2 hours ago\n",

        "Text"=>
         "Adelaide Zoo has confirmed its female giant panda Fu Ni was not pregnant over the last few months despite her behaviour strongly suggesting she was experiencing labour.\nIt was the zoo's third attempt at helping the panda and her mate, Wang Wang, become parents as mature adults and increase the species' population, which currently stands at less than 1,900 in the wild.\nPanda facts:\nWang Wang was born in August 2005 and Fu Ni a year later at Woolong giant panda research centre in China\nThey were given to Adelaide Zoo in late 2009 for a decade but Adelaide officials hope China might agree to extend their stay\nBoth are part of an international giant panda research, conservation and breeding program aimed at preserving the endangered species\nFu Ni has adopted a toy that she has been cradling and holding close to her chest since the false alarm.\nZoos SA senior panda keeper Simone Davey said the zoo had artificially inseminated panda Fu Ni twice in October.\nShe said hormonal changes and changes in her uterus had given them hope Fu Ni had become pregnant.\nMs Davey said Fu Ni experienced contractions and heavy breathing over the weekend that were consistent and common for pandas going into pseudo labour.\n\"It's like a learning curve or a training mechanism for giant pandas, so they have less mismothering the first time round,\" she said.\n\"It gives them the experience to become better mothers when they are actually pregnant.\"\nMs Davey explained the large ratio difference in size between mother and foetus meant ultrasounds could not detect a cub until the last two weeks of pregnancy, which gave the keepers hope that her behaviour meant she was going into labour.\nShe said Fu Ni had experienced re-absorption, which is when all the remnants of a foetus in a failed pregnancy are absorbed back into the body, following past inseminations.\nIt meant there were no physical signs of that pregnancy having taking place.\nThis year, however, progress was made as Fu Ni went into the next stage of pseudo pregnancy, giving Zoos SA staff hope of more success in the next breeding season.\n\"This year also was the first time we saw all these other behaviours like the false labour so we've actually got new information that we haven't seen before that will help us a lot in the future,\" Ms Davey said.\nWang Wang and Fu Ni are the only giant pandas in the southern hemisphere and were given to Adelaide Zoo at young ages so they could naturally adapt to the environment.\n\"Because we are the guinea pigs, it is a unique experience. Hopefully this breeding season we'll see some more improvements,\" Ms Davey said.\nOn previous occasions of pseudo pregnancy, Fu Ni's tendency to rub herself on objects had been considered a nesting behaviour.\nExternal Link:\nFu Ni's scratching had been considered a nesting behaviour.\nTopics:\nFirst posted March 02, 2017 14:05:22\n",

        "Text"=>
         "> Industry > PR & SEOs Listen Up! HitTail is Back to Make You Panda Proof\nPR & SEOs Listen Up! HitTail is Back to Make You Panda Proof\nExactly a year ago today, you may have spotted the relaunch of HitTail... or you may have totally missed it  like I did. New CEO, Rob Walling's plan was to quietly relaunch his new acquisition with as little fanfare as possible. It was a Facebook ad for HitTail, saying SEO Is Dead, which got my attention at the beginning of this year. And, truthfully, to see the ad was like welcoming back an old friend.\nThat is because HitTail is one of my favorite keyword tools of all time.\nYes, I'd forgotten its name, but for most of 2012, I regularly thought to myself, \"with what's happening with Panda, what people really need now is that longtail keyword tool developed by that PR company.\" Despite its almost ludicrous simplicity, HitTail has always done the one thing it does really well  namely, identifying the long tail keyword opportunities you should optimize content for.\nHitTail was first launched in 2006. It was the brainchild of Connie Connors, the CEO of New York PR company, Connors Communication. Compared to the average SEO keyword research tools, HitTail never looked like anything special  but it always punched above it's weight, winning lots of coverage in mainstream media.\nAs  said before, HitTail is a ludicrously simple tool. Anyone can make use of it with next to no SEO knowledge. As Cnet called it back then, in a time when blogs were still the hot new thing  it's \"analytics for the rest of us.\"\nHitTail's Backstory\nLike many keyword and analytics companies founded at the time, HitTail had to contend with Google Analytics being made freely available to everyone who would have previously bought analytics. But HitTail was always a pretty low cost tool that was remarkably good at maintaining clients.\nAround 2009 the software was starting to show it's age, suffering from downtime and bugs were creeping in. In 2010, Rob Walling, a HitTail customer of 5 years, emailed Connors and offered to buy the software. Connors agreed to an undisclosed sum and sold the software and the servers it sat on (remember in 2005 when we all had our own servers?) to Walling.\nWalling is an interesting type of web entreprenuer. He has a team of developers and buys old software companies and refurbishes their products. He then runs the new product on as much as it needs to be profitable (This is not too dissimilar to what Jim Boykin is doing with Webmaster World and Threadwatch which relaunched yesterday ). Walling calls this micropreneurship .\nSetting to work, Walling's team cleared up the 28 or so bugs that had crept into the system, hired a database administrator and moved the entire software as a service (SaaS) to the cloud. All the keywords tracked have been maintained such that some clients now have a 5 year archive of keywords that sit outside of the Googleplex.\nRelaunched exactly a year ago, via a quick post on Hacker News , Walling's new HitTail has suffered no downtime and the improved database means current customers have seen their keyword suggestions increase ten fold. Profits have also increased ten fold, meaning more resources can be re-invested to improve the product.\nSo far, whilst there has been no major functionality change to HitTail, under the new leadership, the software platform now has quick integration with Hubspot, may develop better AdWords integration and a WordPress plugin will be released next week.\nWhat Does It Do?\nAll HitTail does is track all your incoming keywords to your site, stack them against each other in a bar graph and then identify which are the best long tail opportunities for you personally. It's magic is in a simple algorithm which identifies the keywords you should write more about based on the keywords that are driving traffic to your site.\nWhat You Write About Can Rank\nBack then in 2006, for the average SEO, such an analysis could seem like a pursuit of diminishing returns. The labor required to produce the content was most likely not worth the traffic gains. Content production was a chore and most businesses were not open to it  they didn't get why content was important.\nSEO was about gaining big traffic wins in a competitive environment, so we would turn to tools like WordTracker which was excellent at comparing traffic volume against competitiveness. But Wordtracker never had a simple solution for understanding the compeitiveness of the keyword phrases you were already attracting  which, in a nutshell, is exactly what HitTail does.\nSpeaking personally, as a freelance SEO, in a dead heat between the two tools, WordTracker would usually win my money, yet nonetheless, I still found myself paying for HitTail every now and then on their month to month plans for certain new clients.\nThat's because HitTail's data is eminently actionable. It's as actionable as panhandling for gold and finding a nugget. If you don't find that nugget, you move elsewhere, but if you do, boy oh boy, do you take action. Essentially HitTail automates the process of panhandling for potentially golden keyword phrases from all your incoming search query data.\nWhat it lacks in robust analysis it makes up for in total clarity. The SEO tenet it is based on is so simple, so utterly uncomplex, that it took a PR person (someone who lives and breathes content) to boil it down for the rest of the industry.\nNamely, \"What you write about can rank.\" It's true! Regardless of algorithms, links and anchor text, this little fact of the internet elucidates the inalienable right of content creators on the web. Anyone can write about anything, and all of it can rank on search engines.\nThe question then remains: Now that you know you have that freedom, regardless of whether you will succeed or not, what do you want to rank for?\nEvery SEO Needs To Return To That One Simple Idea\nSEOs can be forgiven for believing that HitTail's analysis is an over simplification  a philosophical stretch too far to be considered a robust SEO tool. It could fairly be dismissed as a better tool for Bloggers. Nonetheless, with boots firmly in the SEO camp, I beg to differ.\nHitTail originated from blog land amongst a subset of web users who, from the beginning have been conceptualizing their own web marketing efforts in terms of relationships rather than links, and content rather than keywords. To bloggers, incoming search traffic has just been another channel to grow an audience and develop a more personal relationship with their readers. Bloggers don't write to rank on search engines, they write for people in order to grow their community  whatever search traffic they got was just a bonus.\nPR professionals who get SEO are the same. They understand that search traffic is out there, but beyond search, the aim of PR is to make the message land on listening ears. Where SEOs see cumulative traffic stats, PR professionals see tiny niches of influencers that they can target.\nThat the way in which SEO and PR services are packaged up for clients is completely different, points to core methodological differences in our approaches to online marketing.\nYet, we're not so different as we think. Where SEOs need to be on a monthly retainer to do link development until rankings pay off, PR professionals need to be on a monthly retainer to do story development, until the big placement pays off.\nSEO companies aim to get their client on the front page of Google and Bing, whilst PR companies aim to get their client on the front page of the Wall Street Journal.\nIn the wake of Panda and Penguin, Google's message is clear. Links need to be won through a blend of cunning search strategy and equally cunning PR strategy. Google may have a war on links but it is certainly not a war on relationships. Google's radual socialization of search results is simply changing the link building model to one more of earned media (and arguably what is was always meant to be).\nYet that is not to say, SEO is now PR or vice versa. But both can learn from each other. As Ken McGaffin, former marketer for WordTracker so brilliantly states in 10 Reasons Why Public Relations is a ‘Must-do' for SEO in 2013 , there's a tremendous cascade effect on links as a result of good PR.\nWhat PR knows is that one good article with the right placement (normally a publication) is the difference between getting picked up by the journalist community and going nowhere. What SEOs know is that good rankings on a few terms can bring even more good rankings for many more terms in the long run. Todd Malicoat has always put that ranking phenomenon best, \"all ships rise with the tide.\"\nSo what if the placement of that one good article happens to be at the top of search results? That's the core idea HitTail sells the SEO community and that idea is fundamentally Panda proof.\nHitTail enables bloggers, journalists and SEOs to find that one good keyword that has the best chance of getting that one good placement on the front page of Google. The rest flows from there. Hopefully your story will get picked up and linked to by higher order publications and you will have naturally improved your link profile.\nUltimately, We Earn Our Keywords\nIf you are an SEO, you'll know this better than most: that  one top ranking for a long tail keyword is the crack that lets the light in. From the success of one phrase you can divine the current and future success of your entire SEO strategy. But Google's has spent a year taking our keywords away from us and burying it in webmaster tools.\nAll webmasters should consider that they have earned, fairly and squarely, the keyword data that sent traffic to your website. If Google is going to encrypt data and block tools  that are useful to the functioning of your business and critically important to understanding your customers  then it might be time to start thinking about how you can take that data out of Google as soon as you can.\nUltimately Google can touch and peek into every other apsect of web data, but it still can't touch your own website data or take that away from you. Regardless of the ethics of Google SPYWorld and encrypted referrers, every public piece of keyword data I have ever analyzed was fairly earned by the websites I own, manage, funded or created.\nThe Bottom Line\nThere's no doubt that I am gushing with enthusiasm for HitTail. By no means was it perfect back then, and in a Skype conversation, Walling candidly admitted to some imperfections now. For many users it will still be frustrating that related keyword suggestions are still not searchable. It's still an incredibly simplistic piece of software.\nHowever, this refurbishment is a step in the right direction. With new resources and a profitable future ahead of it, Walling plans to develop the product according to what users ask for.\nWhilst I already have a list as long as my arm for new feature requests, simply what HitTail's can do for me now is important enough. HitTail can take my keyword data out of the machinations of the Googleplex and put it back into my hands.\nSimilarly HitTail has preserved the keyword list their clients have earned for over 5 years now, therefore that tool seems like a good insurance plan to me against a keywordless future. From my discussions with Walling it seems clear to me that there could be an opportunity for customers to help formulate the direction of the service  and right now, post-Panda and post Google SPYWorld, the SEO community needs a new keyword tool.\nFor the record, my dream is that HitTail and Wordtracker team up and make babies.\nWant to stay on top of the latest search trends?\nGet top insights and news from our search experts.\n",

        "Text"=>
         "Shares have been moving up lately in Spirent Communications (LSE: SPT) the provider of test methodologies and solutions for data communications and in Nichols (LSE: NICL) the soft drinks manufacturer. So, is there anything in today's full-year results from these firms to halt the momentum or does progress look set to continue?\nAll looking good\nHeadline figures for Nichols include revenue up 7.4% compared to a year ago, an operating profit rise of 9% and adjusted earnings per share ticking 9.7% higher. That all looks good, but the best figure of all is the directors' hiking of the full-year dividend by 15.3%. I think that move speaks volumes about the how they see the health of the business and its prospects.\nAfter reflecting on \"another very good year\", non-executive chairman John Nichols said he expects the firm's clear strategy for growth to overcome challenging soft drinks markets during 2017. His confidence is underpinned by the company's strong brands, diversification and successful track record of growth.\nThose all-important brands include names such as Vimto, Panda, Sunkist, Levi Roots and Feel Good Drinks. As well as diversity of brands, the firm has sales diversified across markets with Vimto, for example, selling in more than 85 countries. Meanwhile, its track record of growth speaks for itself.\nYear to December\n2011\n",

This allow users to upload and engage with video content based on their interest, while connecting with like-minded individuals both regionally and globally.\n\n\n\nFollowing the rapid rise in demand for online video content, the site was born when Acer and Stefan often found their friends posting videos of their passion, whether it be cycling or wakeboarding, on other social networks were met with a complete lack of interest. This led the pair to create HighlyRated.com, where users are encouraged to Rate or Hate videos based on their merit. Videos that are then the most 'rated' will appear on the site's homepage, providing the user with higher visibility and connectivity.\n\n\n\nCommenting on HighlyRated.com's launch, Co-Founder and CEO Acer Jamal said, \"Beta testing of the site was beyond positive  even with very optimistic expectations, we're delighted with the response so far. Having lived in the UAE on & off for over 20 years, we chose to launch our Middle East office here in UAE due to its reputation as a hub for entrepreneurship. The Middle East is our focus before we expand outward, instead of the other way round, which has been the case with nearly every other social network.\"\n\n\n\nUsers are now encouraged to sign up for the video-based social network by visiting  http://www.HighlyRated.com  . They can then immediately begin creating their own network by following the site's motto of Rate, Create and Participate.\n\n\n# # #\n\n\nAbout HighlyRated.com:\n HighlyRated.com  is a 100% privately owned video-based social media network founded by 2 dedicated entrepreneurs and features numerous categories that cover a multitude of interests. Users can Rate or Hate the video content & directly interact with each other. The site is dedicated to bringing people from all over the world together to share their experiences, passion and laughter  proving that our shared interests bring us together more than they set us apart.\n\nMedia Contacts:\nAcer Jamal\n\n+971 50 301 4794\n\n \n\n\n Submitted by Haley Kirkland  on Thursday, 2 March 2017 at 2:00 PM\n\nCategory:  Consumer Technology\n",

That should stop people leaving quite so many angry comments under stories, they hope.\nStories that use the quiz will see people presented with three short multiple choice questions that they must give the correct response to.

But occasionally its stories are published on the homepage or elsewhere – which brings a whole new set of often angry readers, who tend to undermine the tone in the comments, said NKRbeta journalists.\nMany sites have got rid of comments altogether, arguing that they are becoming hard to maintain, tend to become negative quickly and that people can have their own conversations on Facebook or elsewhere.\nOther websites have attempted to tackle the problem with different technologies.

         "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild review: Nintendo has created an almost perfect Zelda game | The Independent",
        "Text"=>
         "If you’ve pre-ordered a Nintendo Switch , chances are you’re a feisty Nintendo fan eagerly awaiting the latest addition to the Zelda series, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild . Your faith, dear Nintendo worshippers, has not been misplaced as Breath of the Wild marks a fantastic addition to the already mighty series. \nBreath of the Wild sees our elf-like adventurer wake from a 100-year slumber with no memory and Calamity Ganon ruling over Hyrule. From here, Link must piece together his memories, discover his true purpose, and attempt to save the world and Princess Zelda. If losing his memory wasn’t bad enough, Link must also free four gigantic divine beasts and traverse an open world where almost everything is deadly.\nThis, of course, marks the most significant and overwhelmingly positive change to happen to the long running series. Breath of the Wild may be the 19th main-series Zelda game but it’s the first to be completely open-world. Being free to roam the expansive (read: overwhelmingly huge) pastures of Hyrule is magnificent. \nWant to delve into a shrine you spotted seemingly miles away? You can! Want to forget the main quest and document everything on your camera? You can! Want to speak to the local village and complete side quests? You can! Want to spend all your time feeding apples to your horse? You can! The possibilities feel limitless. And for those wanting to complete the main quest, there’s a quasi-structure that requires a lot of exploration but nearly always makes you feel that you’re progressing. \n \nA little on the aforementioned shrines: unlike in previous Zelda games where each cave was few and far between but were long and challenging, the new system means caves are relatively short, offering one or two major challenges. However, there are dozens upon dozens spread throughout Hyrule so their brevity doesn’t matter as another challenge awaits around the corner. Importantly, completing each shrine rewards you an orb: four of these you can exchange for either a heart container or more stamina. You'll need to upgrade these sooner rather than later because, guess what, you'll be dying. A Lot. We're talking dozens and dozens of times. It's wonderfully challenging. \nAnother major new change to the series is that swords, shields, and bows break relatively often, meaning you will have to find new equipment to use. This can be frustrating, as your favourite sword won’t be around very long if you're swinging like a mad man. Luckily, each enemy drops their weapon when they perish, meaning you can save that favourite sword for when the inevitable boss appears. One little nitpick here is that the system to select weapons is slightly difficult to maneuver: obviously, it was built with the Wii U’s second screen in mind. Still, you get used to it eventually.\nGadgets and tech news in pictures\n1/44\nA humanoid robot gestures during a demo at a stall in the Indian Machine Tools Expo, IMTEX/Tooltech 2017 held in Bangalore\nGetty Images\n2/44\nA humanoid robot gestures during a demo at a stall in the Indian Machine Tools Expo, IMTEX/Tooltech 2017 held in Bangalore\nGetty Images\n3/44\nA humanoid robot gestures during a demo at a stall in the Indian Machine Tools Expo, IMTEX/Tooltech 2017 held in Bangalore\nGetty Images\n4/44\nEngineers test a four-metre-tall humanoid manned robot dubbed Method-2 in a lab of the Hankook Mirae Technology in Gunpo, south of Seoul, South Korea\nJung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n5/44\nEngineers test a four-metre-tall humanoid manned robot dubbed Method-2 in a lab of the Hankook Mirae Technology in Gunpo, south of Seoul, South Korea\nJung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n6/44\nThe giant human-like robot bears a striking resemblance to the military robots starring in the movie 'Avatar' and is claimed as a world first by its creators from a South Korean robotic company\nJung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n7/44\nEngineers test a four-metre-tall humanoid manned robot dubbed Method-2 in a lab of the Hankook Mirae Technology in Gunpo, south of Seoul, South Korea\nJung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n8/44\nWaseda University's saxophonist robot WAS-5, developed by professor Atsuo Takanishi\nRex\n9/44\nWaseda University's saxophonist robot WAS-5, developed by professor Atsuo Takanishi and Kaptain Rock playing one string light saber guitar perform jam session\nRex\n10/44\nA test line of a new energy suspension railway resembling the giant panda is seen in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China\nReuters\n11/44\nA test line of a new energy suspension railway, resembling a giant panda, is seen in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China\nReuters\n12/44\nA concept car by Trumpchi from GAC Group is shown at the International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China\nRex\n13/44\nA Mirai fuel cell vehicle by Toyota is displayed at the International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China\nReuters\n14/44\nA visitor tries a Nissan VR experience at the International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China\nReuters\n15/44\nA man looks at an exhibit entitled 'Mimus' a giant industrial robot which has been reprogrammed to interact with humans during a photocall at the new Design Museum in South Kensington, London\nGetty\n16/44\nA new Israeli Da-Vinci unmanned aerial vehicle manufactured by Elbit Systems is displayed during the 4th International conference on Home Land Security and Cyber in the Israeli coastal city of Tel Aviv\nGetty\n17/44\nElectrification Guru Dr. Wolfgang Ziebart talks about the electric Jaguar I-PACE concept SUV before it was unveiled before the Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S\nReuters\n18/44\nThe Jaguar I-PACE Concept car is the start of a new era for Jaguar.

The Slate has two functions: firstly, it provides a map that can be used to create waypoints and see where major quests need you to go. Second, as you progress, you acquire runes that give Link certain powers, such as creating bombs and stopping objects from moving for a limited amount of time. \nThese different powers are used to traverse different obstacles in unique ways, offering enough variety and upgradeability to keep you more than occupied. The only disappointing Rune is the literal camera, which can be used to capture creatures, monsters, and areas, adding their picture to your compendium. Compared to bombs, it’s not exactly exciting. \nOf course, there are core Zelda mainstays that keep Breath of the Wild a Zelda game. Not only are Zelda, Link and Gannon back, but so are the classic sounds, Rupees, and some enemies. The combat system also remains similar, with swords, bombs, and your bow and arrow remaining the main way to defeat enemies.\nNintendo Switch review: the ultimate handheld released too soon\nHaving been in production so long, many fans have been worried about the game’s graphics. On Nintendo Switch, the stylised look works fantastically, even on the small screen. On TV, though, the game comes into its element, the long draw distance being absolutely breath-taking. More importantly, though, like that Lion King meme, everything you see can be yours (to explore). \nThat’s just the half of what Breath of the Wild has to offer. Earlier, I called it ‘overwhelming,’ which has somewhat negative connotations. At times, there feels like there is just so much to explore - where do you begin? But, somehow, Breath of the Wild keeps you on track. You don’t feel lost at any stage as you know, quite simply, that Ganon needs to be defeated. By keeping things simple while giving you seemingly infinite things to do, Nintendo has created an almost perfect Zelda game and one I can’t put down. A must-have for any Nintendo lover.\nReuse content\n",

But Nintendo has confirmed that it is a way of discouraging children from licking or eating the tiny cards.\nPeople who have licked or attempted to eat the cartridges have found the experience awful. The taste also has a tendency to linger, according to games journailst Jeff Gerstman, whose advice after putting one in his mouth was \"do not try this at home\".\n\"Immediately upon touching a Nintendo Switch cartridge one’s tongue is assaulted by a harsh bitterness that spreads like a brush fire through the mouth,\" wrote Mike Fahey on gaming website Kotaku. \"Having a drink on hand helps, but not completely.\n\"The taste and how it spreads suggests some sort of oily residue left on the cartridge. If you’ve ever pinched an orange peel and tasted the oil that oozes from the rind, it’s like that, only without the citrus accents.\"\nMr Fahey suggested that he could taste some of the same flavour on cartridges from the old Nintendo Entertainment System and the Super NES, but that it was a more faint taste and it didn't stick around.\nReuse content\n",

        "Text"=>
         "Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast\nExcerpt\nHere’s How to Avoid a War With China\nIn Avoiding War With China, Amitai Etzioni says that even optimists give the U.S. and China only a one-in-four chance of peace. He thinks those odds can be improved.\nAmitai Etzioni\n03.02.17 6:00 AM ET\nIf you are the betting type, I have a promising bet for you. Wager that the United States and China will engage in a major war in the near future. Some scholars who specialize in international relations, such as John Mearsheimer, contend that a war between the United States and China is more likely today than a 'hot' war between the United States and the USSR ever was. Timothy Garton Ash, a British historian and commentator, states that the United States and China will 'probably' go to war if they do not carefully manage the slew of points of tension between them. Michael Pillsbury, an expert with four decades of experience studying U.S.-China relations, observes that China’s lack of military transparency practically guarantees inadvertent escalation, leading to war.\nOthers consider a war with China inevitable because of an 'iron law' of history, according to which prevailing superpowers such as the United States necessarily fail to yield power quickly enough to a new power such as China, thereby causing rising tensions and, eventually, war. Graham Allison writes, 'The defining question about global order for this generation is whether China and the United States can escape Thucydides’s Trap. The Greek historian’s metaphor reminds us of the attendant dangers when a rising power rivals a ruling power … [Avoiding war] required huge, painful adjustments in attitudes and actions on the part not just of the challenger but also the challenged.' Even optimists, against whom you’d be betting, give the United States and China only a one in four chance of avoiding war. According to Allison’s report, superpowers adjusted and avoided war with rising powers in four out of sixteen cases since 1500. (In one of these cases, Great Britain yielded to the United States during the late 1800s and early 1900s.)\nThis book hopes to sour your bet (with due apologies) by outlining several policies that may allow us to achieve a peaceful transition of power without endangering the United States’ core interests in Southeast Asia—or undermining the United States’ position as a global power. To find a peaceful way, both the United States and China need to change their foreign policies. Scores of books and articles argue what China must do: stop its military buildup, improve its transparency, bring its military more under the control of the government rather than the Communist Party, and transition to a liberal democracy, among other recommendations. This book, in contrast, is written by an American for Americans; it focuses on the actions the United States could take to reduce the probability that the world will face another major war.\nI cannot stress enough that when I point in the following pages to flaws in the ways that the United States is currently dealing with China (for instance, by excluding it from the Trans Pacific Partnership), this does not mean that China has conducted itself better or does not need to mend its ways. It simply means that China’s warts have been amply charted and dissected; this book focuses on what the United States could do better.\nTo proceed, Americans need to engage in a national dialogue, a public debate about what the United States’ China policy is and should be. The United States often engages in such debates about other subjects, such as same-sex marriage, climate change, dealing with ISIS and with Iran. Such a national debate about China policy has not yet happened.\nIndeed, during the most recent presidential primary season, both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates have mainly avoided the subject, though Donald Trump argued that China is out to 'eat our lunch.' Now that the elections are over, and a new administration has come in, this is a particularly opportune time to engage in such a public debate. This book seeks to serve this overdue give-and-take.\nGoing to or sliding into war with a rising China is especially tragic because—as I see it—China and the United States share many complementary interests and have surprisingly few substantive reasons to come to blows. (By 'substantive' I mean those issues that are distinct from symbolic or hyped-up ones, such as the question of who owns a pile of rocks somewhere difficult to find on a map.)\nSome use the terms 'panda huggers' and 'dragon slayers' to categorize analysts and public leaders in the West according to the approaches they recommend adopting toward China; these terms replace the 'doves' and 'hawks' of the Cold War. (I sometimes refer to them as 'Engagers' and 'Adversarians.')\nSome might consider this book to fall on the dovish side. However, I am not a 'panda hugger' but rather someone who has been to war. This experience left me with a strong commitment to seeking peaceful resolutions to international conflicts.\nThe overdue public debate about America’s China policy will not take place in a vacuum. The U.S. military, in the course of carrying out its duty to secure the United States, has identified China as a major strategic threat. Accordingly, it has made the case in the media, in congressional hearings, and in presentations to the White House that the United States should take a tougher approach to China and should build up its military in order to prepare for a war with China. The defense industry supports the same charge for its own reasons. To digress, I do not claim that there exists a military-industrial complex in the sense of a solid military-corporate bloc whose representatives meet at night in a motel in Arlington to plot how to gain glory and profit by pushing the United States into war with China. As a matter of fact, the U.S. military’s various services compete with each other; thus the U.S. Army is much less inclined to target China than the U.S. Air Force and Navy are. And many corporations that make money out of peaceful pursuits compete with defense-focused ones, and defense corporations compete with each other. However, as we shall see, major segments of the military and corporations do have strong, vested interests in preparing for war with China for reasons that do serve their constituents, but not necessarily the good of the United States.\nReprinted from the forthcoming AVOIDING WAR WITH CHINA: Two Nations, One World by Amitai Etzioni by permission of the University of Virginia Press.\nAmitai Etzioni is University Professor in the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies at George Washington University.

        "Text"=>
         "March 2, 2017\nMy time in the Hong Kong dugout\nOur correspondent gets a different perspective on an Associates game\nAnshy Rath makes his maiden List A hundred in the first game   Panda Man\nUnder a tent too low for former seam bowlers from England, Simon Cook , formerly of Middlesex and Kent, tries to find me a chair. He looks every bit the former athlete; you can see how he took 342 first-class wickets.  When he finds me a chair and puts it next to him, I may not literally be his right-hand man, but for this one-dayer (a List A game, not an official ODI) between Hong Kong and Netherlands , I'm sitting to the right of Hong Kong's coach.\nThat will be my place for the next two games. For the first half of the match, I'm afraid of moving in case I break some sort of PMOA (players media officials access) code, so I don't even go to the toilet. And also because the Netherlands manager has made it clear he is not happy I am here.\nCook sits at a trestle table. He has a laptop open and a notebook. Behind his laptop is a big screen, and next to that screen is the analyst Chris \"Wilson\" Pickett's laptop, which is running the Sports Mechanics analyst software. Pickett looks like the kind of wiry opening bat who would annoy you by playing and missing a lot. He previously worked with Sussex, and coaches Hong Kong Dragons, the Hong Kong Chinese team.\nHong Kong are fielding. Cook doesn't give a big speech just before play; they just get out there and do their jobs. Opening bowler Ehsan Nawaz starts the day with five wides. There will be another wide and a misfield in the first over.\nBut there is a bigger problem.\nHong Kong Cricket are pioneers in many ways. They live-stream their games, and not just with a single-camera set-up and the sound of the ground, but with multiple cameras and commentators. The camera crew and producers are experts in their field but not experts in cricket. As the bowler hits the crease, they cut to a sideways view of the game. At other times they focus not on the ball but on close-ups of the stumps. And they regularly put up replays of certain balls ahead of live cricket.\nThis drives Pickett crazy, as it's his job to enter all the data in. At times he has to run between overs and try to train the crews on how to cover the game. For the second game he puts up his own camera and uses that. Associate teams realise that embracing data, as many of the big teams have done, will give them certain advantages. At this level, you can only afford so many mistakes .\nOnce they start getting their data, they see something straight away that bothers them. Nawaz is over-correcting. He bowls big inswingers to left-handers, but when he bowls straight, they swing down the leg side, and when he bowls wide, they don't swing and are often called wides.  Hong Kong have been working on this for a while now.\nJamie Atkinson , one of their star batsmen, is at slip. Atkinson was Hong Kong captain and big things were expected of him, but he had to give up the captaincy when he got a job as a teacher. The batsman takes a big swipe at the ball and there is a flashing edge straight to Atkinson. He never sees it. It smashes him on the head. He plays out the game but has no real impact on it. When he continues to feel unwell, he is taken to a doctor and diagnosed with concussion. He doesn't play in the follow-up game.\nPickett and Cook look at the early groupings from their seamers. They are bowling full and wide when the plan was to bowl shorter and very straight, almost on the leg-and-middle line. From their data and planning, they have seen that both batsmen like the front foot, so banging it into the deck also gives their bowlers more room for error. Cook asks 16-year-old Jhatavedh Subramanyan , the 13th man, to pass the message on to Aizaz Khan, the other opening bowler. Hong Kong today have four teenagers in the XI, the youngest being 17. In the next game they have five.\nHayat is calm, Rath is eager. Rath tries to push the game forward, Hayat tries to slow it down. They both handle pace and spin. They both look like natural batsmen and as if they intimately understand how to construct a one-day chase\nSubramanyan runs off to fine leg with the message. Aizaz starts his next over with a half-volley, which is driven for four. A couple of balls later another full ball is driven away. Cook looks on silently. Then he turns to me and wonders what happened. Perhaps the message wasn't passed on correctly or forcefully enough. Maybe the bowler decided the advice was wrong and his plan was better. Or it could just be that the bowler doesn't have control of his length enough to execute the right ball.  Later Cook asks me what I think of Bob Woolmer's plan to have an earpiece to talk to the captain. He probably wishes he had them for all his players.\nOffspinner Ehsan Khan takes the wicket of Ben Cooper, and Cook passes on a new note: just bowl for dots. The thinking is that this isn't a wicket where you can attack, so the best way is to make the batsmen play shots they shouldn't be playing. Instead, Netherlands start hitting sixes.\nCook reluctantly leaves the tent for a commentary stint, which has been cleared by the match referee. It's the sort of thing that leading international coaches don't often do.\nIn the 27th over, Hong Kong's batting prodigy, 19-year-old Anshy Rath , comes on to bowl. They worry that Rath, a decent left-arm fingerspinner when in form, might have the yips. He clearly does, and is taken for 16 runs.  In the next match, he's brought on in the 42nd over and goes for 15 runs. Between the games Cook had Rath bowling with his eyes closed, and he bowled perfectly, the problem was, he wasn't going to be able to do that in the match.\nHong Kong's captain, Babar Hayat , is an intriguing tactician. \"Babar has plans that no on this earth can understand,\" Pickett will say of him at one stage.\n\"That's why we get investigated,\" says Pickett about how Hong Kong have had to explain themselves to the ACSU before. \"They think we're fixing, but we've just got a lot of strange ideas.\"\nAfter Rath's over they get a bonus wicket as Ehsan, the spinner and slogger, takes a good catch on the boundary, right in front of the HK tent, and then turns and screams at the team. Someone jokes that he might have been upset with some comments about his fielding. But it turns out that in taking the catch, he has he managed to split the webbing in his fingers. Subramanyan asks if he will go back out there, \"Of course,\" he says, \"this happens all the time.\" Sarah Whitehead, the physio, carefully tries to patch up the problem and quickly gets him back on the field. Ehsan's hands are more tape than fingers. Two overs later he is back off, as his hand is bleeding, and Whitehead goes through the motions again.\nHong Kong continually set fields for Netherlands captain Peter Borren , keeping mid-on and mid-off up. They also put a specialist fielder for the reverse sweep. None of these things bothers Borren. He still plays the reverse sweep. \"Reverse sweep is an ego shot,\" Cook says. Later Borren slaps a straight six.\nCook believes in the roles triangle, which is asking a player to accept his role within the team, train in the skills needed for that role, and then execute it on match days. This isn't easy to explain to players who are the stars of their clubs and don't understand that at this level they might just be role players.\nThere are also problems specific to Hong Kong Cricket. Like, for the longest time, they essentially only had eight players they could confidently pick. They picked the three best fielders from the rest. That was because there isn't much cricket played in Hong Kong. Sometimes players can go three weeks without a game because there simply aren't enough grounds in the country - eight in total if you include all the AstroTurf grounds and the school grounds on which they roll out a temporary wicket.\nThere are also culturally specific problems. One young player was offered the chance to play in an emerging-teams tournament against Sri Lanka and India, but he turned it down because it would interfere with his schooling. Another player, Shahid Wasif , is a student who also works as a security guard from 7pm to 7am.\nBabar Hayat is run out for 86 in the second one-dayer   Panda Man\nNetherlands end with 330 runs. As they eat their lunch, Cook and Pickett discuss the fact that Hong Kong bowled 50% dot balls but also let through a boundary an over. They believe their bowlers think ball by ball, like amateurs, rather than about stringing together good overs and spells.\nCook takes out a whiteboard and writes where he wants the team to be at 15 overs (95 for 2), and where he wants them at 35 (222 for 4).\nBorren bowls the third over after his opener, Vivian Kingma, bowls a shocker, and Cook wistfully says how great it would be to have someone with that sort of experience in his side, who can also do whatever is needed at any time\nThe other opening bowler, Paul van Meekeren , is bowling fast, and some of his balls are tagging sideways. Pickett talks about how they have data on van Meeekeren, and how with the Sports Mechanics app, the players can watch any bowler any time they want to learn more about them.\nThe chat moves to stealing runs, and running in general. The team has just had a revolution in the way they think about running between the wickets, and while they have seen more runs, they have also seen more run-outs.  Cook just wants them to think there is a run every ball, to have that intent.\nAs he talks about this, 19-year-old opener Chris Carter is out there batting. Carter is clearly a talented player, but he is also new to being a specialist batsman. His technique is strong, his eye is decent, but he gets trapped in his innings (he makes 24 from 64 in the next game) and can't find singles. His batting is fine; his run-making needs work.\nAnd it's not just him. Both teams have players who hit boundaries but who don't rotate the strike enough.  Cook wants all his players to know that a defensive shot doesn't just need to go straight back to the bowler. That you can drop your hands, turn your wrists, or even move across the crease before the ball is bowled to change the angle. As he talks about it, Carter is out lbw after not picking the left-arm wristspinner.\nThe concussed Atkinson follows soon after, and at 51 for 2, there is a bit of worry in the team. With Hayat and Rath at the crease, Cook turns his attention to the next batsman, Nizakat Khan .  He tells him they don't need to over-attack, they have time to knock it around and just go at 5.5 an over for the next 20 overs. But if the ball is there to be hit, hit it. You get the feeling that Cook always is a bit cautious with his middle order, because although they don't need much prompting to go full nuclear.\nCook takes a big breath and gets up. After the handshakes he takes his team out to the middle. He speaks softly, like a disappointed teacher. He wants them to know that they played outstandingly well, but from 250 for 2, they threw it away\nCarter comes over to Cook's computer and looks at his lbw a few times, as much as anything to see if it is out, and then to confirm what he thought: he chose the wrong ball to reverse-sweep and didn't pick which way it was spinning. He then looks at a couple of his boundaries. What he doesn't look at is the many balls he didn't score off. For Carter, the boundaries aren't the problem - he will hopefully learn to read wrist spin better. The most simple way he can improve is by facing fewer dots.\nThere is a huge shout behind for Rath's wicket, but the umpire is unmoved. A message from the middle at drinks confirms that he had smashed it. Hayat gets dropped, and that noticeably relaxes the team.\nRath and Hayat also batted together for a very long time in the first-class match before the two one-dayers.  Hayat made 173 and 31, Rath 98 not out and 88.\nThe two of them are so different. Rath looks well coached, thinks cleverly about the game, and you can feel him itching to score. When he goes over mid-off, it is as cricket is intended. He has great feet and hands. A middle-order player at his best, thrust into the top of the Hong Kong order, in the last few months he has finally made the most of his obvious batting talent. Very soon he will sign with a county .\nHayat plays languid strokes and hits the ball smoothly. There have been worries about his fitness. Often he plays one big innings and then struggles. But here he is, batting beautifully, even if his running between the wickets is at times non-existent (he is run out at a crucial moment in the second one-dayer, because he was ball-watching).\nTheir partnership is well constructed. Hayat is calm, Rath is eager. Rath tries to push the game forward, Hayat tries to slow it down. They both handle pace and spin. They both look like natural batsmen and as if they intimately understand how to construct a one-day chase. At the end of the series Borren says the Hong Kong top order is very good, and he should know just from bowling at Rath and Hayat practically all tour.\nWhen a six is hit into the local apartments, the Hong Kong players cheer, but the coaching staff know that when a ball is hit there, it costs US$100, as you can't go into the private residence to get it back.\nEven with the sixes, Hayat's majestic calm and Rath's professional scoring, the next man in, Nizakat, is very nervous. He sits behind Cook and Pickett, and Cook's calming chats do not do the trick. You can feel his nervous energy, or hear his spikes rattling on the concrete nervously. He asks Pickett how many overs are left for each bowler. Later he asks again. And then one more time. \"Just don't worry about it, go out there and bat,\" Pickett finally tells him. It's quite a thing for the analyst to say, but it's probably what Nizakat now needs to do.\nEhsan Khan appeals for a wicket in the drawn first-class game   Panda Man\nRath brings up his hundred, and Hayat keeps going as well. They need 82 off the final ten overs with eight wickets remaining.  It is not going to be easy, but they could not be in a much better position chasing 331.\nThen Hayat is out stumped to Borren, and despite Hong Kong being ahead in the game, I sense Cook get nervous. He picks up a plastic spoon from the ground and starts playing with it.  I start to see a pattern when Cook is nervous: he will get silent, fixate on something small, and then jump up suddenly to impart some guidance for the next player.\nNizakat, after all his nervousness off the field, looks quite comfortable on it.  He smashes Borren for a six and then flat-bats a van Meekeren short ball back into the apartment complex. Nizakat is an extraordinary talent. He goes from looking like he is about to miss the ball by a foot to creaming it over extra cover for six. He smashed a hundred against the Sydney Thunder bowlers in a practice match before the Big Bash this season, bringing up the milestone in the last over with a six. In the second game against Netherlands, he runs down the wicket at Roelof van der Merwe and plays a squash shot over cover for six.\nWith Nizakat and Rath at the crease, the target comes down to 46 from 36 balls. But at no stage does Cook feel overly confident.\nRath then tries to put away a poor ball from Michael Rippon, but hits it very high and is caught for 134. Rath is fuming as he comes off the ground. His 130 is brilliant, but as he reaches the change room, he screams the sort of word that ESPNcricinfo doesn't publish. Cook leans into me and says, \"It's great to see someone that that kind of anger after they've made a hundred\".\nNizakat hits the next ball straight to long-on.  \"That is brainless,\" Cook says to no one in particular. He writes an angry note in his book before placing it aggressively back on his desk. The whole camp feels edgier now. If Cook was the first to feel really nervous, they've now all joined him.\nIt's 30 off 24 balls with five wickets in hand and no set batsman at the crease. The two batsmen in the middle are so nervous, at one stage one goes down the wrong end to bat at the end of the over. Cook laughs a gallows laugh.\nHe has already spoken to both batsmen out in the middle, and now he goes to the remaining batsmen and talks them through what they need to do. He could not be more calm or clear: We should play van der Merwe out. Van Meekeren will bowl short, use his pace to hit him behind the wicket. And most importantly wait for boundary balls. Netherlands are under just as much pressure as we are.\nThen Ehsan, who had been slogging luckily, is given out lbw. All the Hong Kong players believe it is off the glove and they crowd around the replay, which shows pretty much that. It is an exceptionally poor decision at a very crucial moment. No one mentions that Rath edged a catch early in his innings and wasn't given out.\nNow no players are sitting down, it is too tense, they pace as individuals, but it's a group worry. Cook doesn't send messages out to the middle at the end of each over, he doesn't panic, and he doesn't do much, he just tries to make sure every batsman is prepared and plays sensible cricket.\nA full ball is scooped into the leg side. Netherlands scream \"Catch\", a lone Hong Kong voice screams \"No.\"  And then the catch is taken. Someone says that the tail always do this, someone else says, \"That's why we shouldn't let them in.\"  Another wicket falls, and the talk stops altogether. Cook just refolds his arms.\nWhen a six is hit into the local apartments, the Hong Kong players cheer, but the coaching staff knows that when a ball is hit there, it costs US$100, as you can't go into the private residence to get it back\nThey have consistently lost wickets to shots that were not on. When the ninth wicket falls, Hong Kong need 16 off ten balls. Carter walks up to where his gloves have been drying in the sun and picks them up.  If ever there was a sign that the No. 11, Tanveer Ahmed, is not expected to help them win, it's this. An edged boundary from him gets them close; they need 11 from 8, then ten from the last over. Nadeem Ahmed will face it; van Meekeren will bowl it.\nNadeem mishits the first ball. No run is taken. \"Just gotta get one of those away,\" says Cook. Then a wide from a short ball. Another mishit, another run refused. Then another knocked-back single, which drives Cook mad. Then another wide. Then a taken single. \"Why take it now?\" says Cook. Another single. At no stage has either batsman tried to use the pace of van Meekeren against him. They knew he was going to bowl short. He did bowl short, and they did nothing with it.\nThe batsmen almost exchange bats after a chat. Pickett laughs, Cook just shakes his head in disbelief. They need a six off the last ball to tie. It is mistimed to long-off. They don't even take the single.  Someone mentions net run rate, but it's not the most important thing on people's minds.\nCook takes a big breath and gets up. After the handshakes he takes his team out to the middle. He speaks softly, like a disappointed teacher. He wants them to know that they played outstandingly well, but from 250 for 2, they threw it away. He tells them they were neither calm nor smart, and references another game where the same thing happened. He praises their talent but questions their decision-making. \"We want to make a name for ourselves and we had a chance to do that today.\" He tails off at the end.\nI go back to my seat to pack up.  Cook comes over and asks me what I think about the game. At first I am flattered. I think I have penetrated the inner circle. I am an analyst. But then I realise that in truth, he's just out of answers.\nI tell him that maybe he could have micromanaged more when the collapse started, sent out more notes, been more vocal. But even as I say it, I hedge, because I am not even sure that any of that would have worked. Cook shrugs and goes silent.\nNetherlands will make over 300 again in the next game. Ehsan will over-compensate for his swing again. Hong Kong try will try to execute the correct plan for opener Stephan Myburgh, but the bowlers won't follow through on it. On his whiteboard Cook will write, \"When you get in, go on and win the game\". Rath and Hayat will again make a big partnership but neither will bat through to the end. Nizakat will again thrill, and then get out well before his job is done. And Hong Kong will again struggle with their middle order, and their tail will again not be good enough to complete the win.\nThe game will remind me of something that Cook said after the first loss. \"We can say we are learning, but not if we keep making the same mistakes.\"\nHong Kong, the team with only three proper cricket grounds, have scored over 600 chasing over two games, but without that win, it feels like it's all for nothing.\nIn the second game, I notice one different thing from Cook. Hong Kong had managed to keep the Netherlands top order under pressure much better. Since they were batting too slow, you could sense they were going to attack when van der Merwe came in. Cook realised it after one attacking shot.\nThere are no quiet pauses this time. He is up and tells his 12th man to pass on the message: \"They are going to come at us hard, but if you can hang in there, two quick wickets might come and that will knock the stuffing out of them.\"\nBut just telling his 12th man isn't enough, so he runs over to a sweeper on the boundary and tells him too. Then he runs off and tells another sweeper the same message. If Cook could, he'd tell them all.\nNetherlands do come hard, a chance is created, and it is dropped. The next over, a wicket is taken.  Cook just shrugs his shoulders and goes quiet again.\nJarrod Kimber is a writer for ESPNcricinfo. @ajarrodkimber\n © \nESPN Sports Media Ltd.\n    \n",

The Harpursville zoo said that April hasn't changed much physically but that there has been \"significant movement once again in the belly.\"\nApril and Oliver: Love Story Behind Famous Giraffe's Pregnancy\nA cold front moves into the northeast on Thursday and the zoo suggested this might \"shake things up.\" Other than the belly movement, April's keeper and vet also documented \"increased tail raising and holding,\" as well as \"periods of increased movement/pace\" Wednesday night.\nOver the last week, April has captivated tens of millions of people across the world who have been checking in on her via the live stream in anticipation of the birth of her fourth calf.\nSome 60,000 people were tuned in to the stream at the crack of dawn Thursday. The graceful giraffe appeared calm and collected as she picked at stray pieces of hay and stretched around to scratch a back itch. Watch it above.\nThe zoo, which unveiled April-inspired emojis and t-shirts as the fan base for the 15-year-old long-necked beauty continues to swell, said twin Barbados lambs and a Patagonian Cavy were born early Wednesday.\nNY Zoo Giraffe Stream Banned for 'Nudity' Back After Outcry\n\"Babies babies everywhere!\" the Animal Adventure Park posted Wednesday morning. \"Just not yet in the giraffe barn.\"\nApril's pregnancy was catapulted into global headlines last week after YouTube briefly yanked the zoo's live stream following complaints by animal activists that it violated the site's policies concerning \"nudity and sexual content.\" Thousands upon thousands of commenters voiced their frustration on Facebook and YouTube, and the stream was restored within an hour or so.\nGiraffe pregnancies last for 15 months. Labor lasts anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Once April goes into active labor, zookeepers will go in to help her the rest of the way. The calf will be about 150 pounds and 6 feet tall at birth and up and walking in about an hour.\nThe zoo said it will hold an online competition to name the baby giraffe once it's born.\nUS-Born Panda Bao Bao Lands in China After Leaving DC Zoo\nPublished 2 hours ago\n",

         "Asia: Saudi Arabia’s one-stop shop for economic opportunities",
        "Text"=>
         "Asia: Saudi Arabia’s one-stop shop for economic opportunities\n👤  2958 readers have read this article !\nBy 2017-03-02\nBy Ankit Panda\nIn the final days of February, Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, flanked by a 600-strong delegation, embarked on a month-long tour of the Asia-Pacific, where he is visiting Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Japan, China, the Maldives, and, on his way back to the Middle East, Jordan.\nSaudi kings seldom undertake such ambitious regional tours, but King Salman's undertaking is an extension of the kingdom's more ambitious outreach to the Asia-Pacific since King Abdullah's death in 2015.\nSaudi state media and the Royal Court have portrayed the trip as primarily concerned with energy and investment matters, but the broader geopolitical context motivating this rare month-long regional tour by the king merits a closer look.\nThe king's trip can be bifurcated into two tranches: China and Japan will fulfil one set of priorities while the trips to Malaysia, Indonesia, and Maldives satisfy another.\nChina and Japan\nFirst, while crude oil prices have somewhat recovered from their nadir in late 2015 and early 2016, Riyadh remains committed to its longer-term plan to reduce its dependence on oil revenues. In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman's visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world's largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king's attention; no surprise, then, that Salman's Asian itinerary includes stops in the region's two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing's voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran's broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won't play along willingly with Riyadh's geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman's itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam's prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh's interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince's lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king's visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city's incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as 'Ahok'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country's authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL's forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman's arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country's increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it's worth remembering that Riyadh's look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia's broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh's dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

         "A UC Santa Barbara global studies major died in his sleep on Feb. 15 in his Santa Barbara home.\nAnthony 'Tony' JiaQian Tsang was born in Vancouver, Canada, on May 25, 1993. He went to elementary and middle school in Hong Kong before moving to Dallas with his family, where he enrolled in Flower Mound High School.\nAnthony Tsang, described as mischievous yet lighthearted and giving by his loved ones, was the source of many hilarious stories and was known for his carefree, easygoing personality. Photo courtesy of Michelle Lew\nTiana Tsang, Anthony Tsang’s younger sister, said her brother did not care what others thought of him and 'was his own person' who was willing to be friends with anyone.\nTiana Tsang said she never realized how generous her brother was while growing up, but as she reminisced, she realized how much he gave to her. She said Anthony Tsang saved up his allowance to buy her a stuffed animal panda that she wanted for her sixth birthday.\n'He remembered that I wanted it, and he went back to buy it for me,' she said. 'So it’s just like little things that I didn’t really think about at the time but now when I go back, it just really matters to me.'\nTiana Tsang also said her brother was incredibly selfless and always looking out for others.\n'After he passed away, a bunch of his friends came out with stories about him and a lot of things he did, I never knew about, and a lot of us never knew about, that showed how selfless he was,' she said.\nMichelle Lew, Tony’s fiancée, said they did everything together.\n'He was my best friend, the one I shared everything with,' Lew said. 'Since the day we met, for two years, we only spent maybe a total of five nights apart.'\nLew said Anthony could brighten anyone’s day and was able to connect with those around him through his diverse interests and cheerful personality.\n'He was really, for lack of a better word, goofy. He was always messing around, always the silly one, trying to make people laugh,' Lew said.\nLew and Anthony Tsang lived in Santa Barbara together after meeting on Tinder in San Jose two years ago. They owned two Jack-Russell-Chihuahua mixes and enjoyed going to Arroyo Burro Beach together with their dogs.\n'The big thing that stuck out was how we met, because we actually met on Tinder. So that was a one-in-a-million thing,' Lew said. 'The first thing that he messaged me was a pick up line, which was: ‘I’m looking for my next wife on Tinder.’'\nLew said a year after they met, they were engaged and planned to marry after they finished college.\n\n'Everything just fit together by random chance,' Lew said.\nIn high school, Anthony Tsang was on the cross country team with his friend, Jonathan Wyatt. The two were friends all throughout high school.\nWyatt described Anthony Tsang as 'curious and mischievous ... but also extremely charismatic and caring for other people.'\n'It was quite an interesting combination … but it honestly made him a really fun person, and I enjoyed spending a lot of time with him,' Wyatt said.\nWyatt said Anthony Tsang was always getting into trouble in high school and said once he and Anthony Tsang attempted to steal an old computer out of a shed on the high school campus.\nWyatt said even though the scheme was his idea, Anthony Tsang took most of the blame after they were caught.\n'It was the most ridiculous thing ever, so funny,' Wyatt said. 'And Tony was like, man, this always happens to me.' It was great, and honestly I’d give anything just to relive those days again.'\nWyatt said Anthony Tsang’s other friends would describe him as 'someone you could count on, no matter what it was.'\n'I think the fact that we could always count on him really was like one of the bigger takeaways from his personality because no matter what situation you were in ... he wasn’t really one to judge people,' Wyatt said.\nWyatt also said he admired Anthony Tsang’s adventurous personality, which made a 'huge impact' on his own high school experience.\n'He never really had a stop button. It was always go go go,' Wyatt said. 'It was very different from how most people live their life, I feel.'\nTiana Tsang said her brother wanted to be a U.S. ambassador to Mexico because he 'really loved it.'\nHe traveled to Mexico on vacation multiple times with Lew, and Anthony Tsang said he loved how 'nice' and 'chill' everyone was there.\nAccording to Lew, Anthony Tsang was a 'big beer enthusiast,' which she said might have contributed to his love of Mexico.\n'He liked ... just how everyone is so easygoing,' Lew said. 'He liked just sitting on the beach and going in the ocean. He liked how friendly everyone was, just something about Mexico’s culture … he was comfortable there.'\nLew and her fiancé traveled to Canada, Las Vegas and Mexico together. They planned to visit Hawaii and backpack through Europe.\nAnthony Tsang enjoyed listening to EDM, country and indie rock music and was a Dallas basketball and football fan. He liked to draw and snowboard and loved cars, especially Porsches.\n'A couple weeks ago, we went to Porsche, and he was super excited because he got to test drive one,' Lew said. 'We went back two days later for me to test drive cars, but then he test drove it again.'\nTiana Tsang said her brother was always willing to try new things and lived a carefree life.\n'He always wanted to experience life as much as possible, and I know it sounds really cheesy, but that’s honestly just the kind of person he was,' Tiana Tsang said. 'And one thing that I really say is that, like, he really lived more life in his 23 years than some people do in their whole entire lives.'\nA version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, March 2, 2017, print edition of the Daily Nexus.\nRelated\n",

         "Credit: (photo by Keats Elliott)\nIn the photo (L-R), entertainment superstar Kim Kardashian West was on hand to kick off the second annual Children’s Hospital Los Angeles Make March Matter fundraising campaign with patients Saylor Pierson, 7, and Grace Rose, 14. The campaign aims to raise $1 million in March. (Pierson is the campaign's poster girl).\nNewswise - LOS ANGELES (March 1, 2017) – Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) launched its second annual Make March Matter™ campaign Wednesday. Longtime CHLA supporter Kim Kardashian West joined the hospital to kick off the campaign, which has attracted the commitment of more than 100 businesses in Los Angeles and the Coachella Valley. The month-long community fundraising drive is helping local businesses rally community participation to raise $1 million in the month of March to support children’s health in Los Angeles and surrounding communities.\n'Make March Matter is a movement uniting companies and individuals to bring awareness to the healthcare needs of children and to maintain the programs and services at CHLA that address those needs,' says Children’s Hospital Los Angeles president and CEO Paul Viviano. 'We are fortunate to have such a compassionate and loyal group of partners helping us to fulfill our mission of creating hope and building healthier futures for our patients and their families.'\nEach year, CHLA treats children who face a broad range of health issues, from common illnesses to traumas to chronic diseases. The hospital is also dedicated to innovation, supporting advances in research designed to improve pediatric health outcomes and partnering with physicians across the nation to bring the best care here to children in Los Angeles.\nThe hospital relies on the generosity of the community to support its groundbreaking pediatric research and the complex care it provides for critically ill and injured children. Last year, 67 local business and corporate partners helped the inaugural campaign exceed its $1 million goal, raising a total of $1.3 million to aid in funding life-saving care for children in Los Angeles.\nHere’s how the community and individuals can help Make March Matter:\n• Support the businesses that support CHLA. For a complete list of the more than 100 participating partners and local events taking place throughout the month of March, go to MakeMarchMatter.org.\n• Make a donation at MakeMarchMatter.org. \n• Individuals may share how they are participating in the campaign on social platforms using #MakeMarchMatter\nCorporate Partners\nCorporations across the southland have agreed to support community members in giving back. Each business has selected a unique way to contribute to the campaign’s collective impact—some sell specific items with proceeds supporting CHLA patients, others devote a portion of overall sales for the entire month and still others create their own unique fundraising campaigns to galvanize their employees and consumers to contribute.\n\"Panda Restaurant Group is honored to be part of Children's Hospital Los Angeles' Make March Matter campaign again this year,\" says Calvin Lee, vice president of Operations. \"Giving is one of Panda's core values and it inspired our associates' passion to raise $350,000 to help children in need last year. We are committed to be the campaign's top fundraiser again in 2017.\"\nBy visiting, shopping and dining with a business supporting #MakeMarchMatter, individuals can activate donations to support the care of patients at CHLA.

         "'Significant Movement' in April the Giraffe's Belly, Zoo Says as Thousands Remain Glued to Live Stream\nTens of millions of people across the globe have tuned into the live stream in anticipation of the birth of April's fourth calf\nWhat to Know\nTens of millions of people worldwide have been watching the stream in anticipation of the birth of \"April\" the giraffe's fourth calf\nHer story was vaulted into global headlines after activists complaining of \"nudity\" got the live stream yanked from YouTube last week\nThe live stream was back online about an hour and a half after the brouhaha started\nThere's been a lot of kicking in the belly of everyone's favorite pregnant giraffe April, the upstate New York zoo that's been monitoring her health and updating her millions of fans said in a daily update.\n\"Watch closely for strong kicks from within!\" the Animal Adventure Park posted Wednesday night. The Harpursville zoo said that April hasn't changed much physically but that there has been \"significant movement once again in the belly.\"\nLove Story Behind World's Most Famous Giraffe Pregnancy\nA cold front moves into the northeast on Thursday and the zoo suggested this might \"shake things up.\" Other than the belly movement, April's keeper and vet also documented \"increased tail raising and holding,\" as well as \"periods of increased movement/pace\" Wednesday night.\nOver the last week, April has captivated tens of millions of people across the world who have been checking in on her via the live stream in anticipation of the birth of her fourth calf.\nSome 60,000 people were tuned in to the stream at the crack of dawn Thursday. The graceful giraffe appeared calm and collected as she picked at stray pieces of hay and stretched around to scratch a back itch. Watch it above.\nThe zoo, which unveiled April-inspired emojis and t-shirts as the fan base for the 15-year-old long-necked beauty continues to swell, said twin Barbados lambs and a Patagonian Cavy were born early Wednesday.\nNY Zoo Giraffe Stream Banned for 'Nudity' Back After Outcry\n\"Babies babies everywhere!\" the Animal Adventure Park posted Wednesday morning. \"Just not yet in the giraffe barn.\"\nApril's pregnancy was catapulted into global headlines last week after YouTube briefly yanked the zoo's live stream following complaints by animal activists that it violated the site's policies concerning \"nudity and sexual content.\" Thousands upon thousands of commenters voiced their frustration on Facebook and YouTube, and the stream was restored within an hour or so.\nGiraffe pregnancies last for 15 months. Labor lasts anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Once April goes into active labor, zookeepers will go in to help her the rest of the way. The calf will be about 150 pounds and 6 feet tall at birth and up and walking in about an hour.\nThe zoo said it will hold an online competition to name the baby giraffe once it's born.\nUS-Born Panda Bao Bao Lands in China After Leaving DC Zoo\nPublished 2 hours ago | Updated 56 minutes ago\n",

In this project, the kingdom will need willing partners and investors in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe National Transformation Plan (NTP), conceived by Mohammed bin Salman, the young and ambitious deputy crown prince, has set out nearly 350 targets for Saudi Governmental bodies that will require solid foreign direct investment.\nIndeed, King Salman\'s visit should be seen as the culmination of moves that were put in place by the deputy crown prince in mid-to-late 2016, when the NTP was announced, followed immediately by his own visits to Japan and China in particular.\nIn Japan and China, the deputy crown prince - who is also the defence minister - received assurances from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping that their countries would promote important inbound investment into the kingdom.\nTokyo and Beijing, meanwhile, as large net importers of energy, see a good relationship with the kingdom as fundamentally in their national interest. China overtook the United States as the world\'s largest importer of crude in October 2016.\nThe deputy crown prince alone can accomplish just so much, though. The crown jewel, so to speak, in the National Transformation Plan for Saudi Arabia is the forthcoming initial public offering for state oil giant Saudi Aramco.\nSeeking out investment from Asian heavyweights such as China and Japan in this endeavour merits the king\'s attention; no surprise, then, that Salman\'s Asian itinerary includes stops in the region\'s two largest economies.\nWith China, Saudi Arabia also sees an increasingly significant geopolitical counterweight to the US, whose foreign policy has grown uncertain since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\nIn particular, amid an intensifying regional struggle against Iran, which took on a new character in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, the kingdom has seen the value of courting influence in China.\nBeijing\'s voice at the United Nations Security Council and the global stage more broadly on matters ranging from the implementation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the kingdom has strongly criticised, to Tehran\'s broader regional moves, leaves it a valuable partner for Saudi Arabia.\nBeijing, however, won\'t play along willingly with Riyadh\'s geopolitical plans for the Middle East. Since the 2016 nosedive in relations between the two regional heavyweights, China has sought to play an even hand, keeping its ties with both states on good footing.\nThe second set of countries included on Salman\'s itinerary - Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Maldives - are compelling geopolitical targets for the kingdom in different ways.\nFirst, all four nations are Sunni Muslim majority, with Islam being the state religion in both Brunei and the Maldives. (Indonesia is constitutionally secular. The Malaysian constitution, on the other hand, leaves it officially secular while acknowledging Islam\'s prominent role in society.) All are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nViewing Saudi engagement with these countries strictly through the lens of Islam, of course, would oversimplify the extent of Riyadh\'s interests, but any time the Saudi King visits a majority-Muslim country, pan-Islamic rhetoric features prominently on the agenda and these four states are no exception.\nMoreover, despite widespread perceptions of and speculations on Saudi Arabia as having a role in enabling the spread of global Sunni armed groups over the decades, including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the kingdom has been working overtime to cement its position as a counterterror powerhouse in the Muslim world.\nLast year, under the deputy crown prince\'s lead, Riyadh declared the foundation of a multi-country Islamic Military Alliance, nominally uniting a wide-range of Muslim-majority states against the ISIL. The deputy crown prince, in January 2016, met with the Defence Ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Deputy Defence Minister of Brunei to confer on the matter.\nMaldives, as one of the highest per capita contributors of foreign fighters to the ISIL, was included in the alliance. Malaysia supported the alliance, but did not sign up for a military role. Indonesia and Brunei, meanwhile, expressed support for the initiative.\nThe king will be looking to bolster perceptions of pan-Islamic cooperation against terror in the region, while also advancing the broader bilateral agenda.\nWith regional economic heavyweights Malaysia and Indonesia in particular, King Salman and his coterie of advisers will also be looking to advance economic cooperation in line with the objectives of the NTP. Jakarta, which sees a Saudi king visit after a 47-year break, expects up to $25bn in inbound investment.\nThe Saudi king\'s visit coincides with concerns that Indonesian Islam is beginning to shed its historic reputation for tolerance and moderation amid months of protests in Jakarta against the city\'s incumbent Chinese-Christian Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as \'Ahok\'.\nWith the race for the Jakarta governorship under way now, with tensions still hot from the popular outcry against Ahok for perceived blasphemy against Islam, Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung expressed his hope that Saudi Arabia would promote moderate Islam.\nRadicalisation in Indonesia remains limited, but the country\'s authorities have grown concerned about the ISIL\'s forays into the region after a January 2016 attack in Jakarta. Days before King Salman\'s arrival in the country, another ISIL-linked attacker belonging to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a local terror group, set off a small bomb in Bandung .\nIn this context, anti-Wahhabi moderate Sunni Islamic Indonesian groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama have long complained about Saudi-financed efforts in Indonesia to spread Salafi-Wahhabi, thought as a source of the country\'s increasingly perceptible rise in hardline Islam.\nIn Kuala Lumpur, on the first leg of his trip, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and Saudi Aramco signed a $7bn agreement that will see Saudi investment flow into an oil refinery and petrochemical project. While the investment ostensibly provides much-needed relief to Petronas, which had been struggling under low oil prices, Saudi investment in Malaysia has drawn public scrutiny since revelations that the kingdom may have been involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, whereby Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is accused of appropriating nearly $1bn from a state development company, claiming that the money was a gift from Saudi Arabia.\nLooking eastwards\nAs King Salman heads to Asia, it\'s worth remembering that Riyadh\'s look eastward is not sudden, but borne of a strategic plan incorporating the priorities of the NTP and Saudi Arabia\'s broader global agenda.\nSaudi Arabia, like so many states in the region, is betting on the centre of gravity in global affairs shifting away from the West and towards the East in the coming years.\nRiyadh\'s dramatic plans to overhaul its economic model, paired with its historic bid to maintain its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world, leave pursuing ties with Asia-Pacific states non-optional.

        "Text"=>
         "Megan Bailey, Cranbourne Leader\nMarch 3, 2017 12:00am\nTHE Casey councillors and officers taking a trip to China next month will not be visiting giant pandas, the world’s largest shopping mall or an ancient street.\nCasey mayor Sam Aziz today hit back at criticism over the draft itinerary of next month’s seven-night trip, and said the delegation was solely to investigate investment opportunities for the city.\nThe Cranbourne Leader was given a draft itinerary listing stops for the  25,000 visit earlier this week, which included the New Century Global Centre — the world’s largest shopping centre — the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding and the Jinli Ancient Street.\nGiant Panda Research Centre\nBut Cr Aziz said today the itinerary was created by a consultant and the “real” itinerary was yet to be released.\n“Last time (in 2013) I visited four cities in five days and I didn’t even get to see the Great Wall,” Cr Aziz said.\n“The cultural visits will be to schools to develop relationships between schools and universities;  25,000 is actually quite insignificant when you consider the last trip cost  7000 and delivered  22 million in property investment in the city.”\nThe draft itinerary provoked a storm of criticism from the public, with many saying it was not the council’s place to dip its toes into foreign affairs.\nTroy Lacey said: “As a person that lives in Casey this is a ridiculous use of funds.”\n“My rates should go to improving the area, not heading to China on a holiday disguised as a business trip,” he posted.\nGeoff Hunter said: “City of Casey ... can waste  25,000 on a trip to China but they refuse to do something about the deplorable state of the unmade section of Ballarto Rd in Clyde Village where the road corrugations are so rugged and dangerous that serious damage is done to the residents’ vehicles.”\nSarah Skidmore asked: “What research have you done with businesses in our local area? You speak about the defence industry. Who deals with China in this industry? We have Federal departments that businesses deal with. I wouldn’t let the council either speak for my business or run it. This is not your role. Sam, you and the other councillors are grandstanding in areas you have no expertise.”\nAnd Michael Webster suggested: “Show him a doco on pandas, there are plenty on YouTube, and let him visit Chaddy on his lunch break. Problem solved ...”\nThe mayor’s Facebook page attracted support as well as criticism, with some praising his efforts to attract investment.\nEvelyn Gansky posted: “The greatest amount of thought, planning and vision has gone into this possible deal. You do more on a daily basis than our so-called politicians. The Casey community should be eternally grateful.”\nThe visit will also take in Shanghai, Shuanghui County in Chengdu and the Longquanyi District in Chengdu.\nThe trip was mooted two years ago and Casey Council had hoped that businesses and neighbouring Cardinia councillors would join next month’s trip but a spokesman for the Cardinia said it was unnecessary for it to spend the money.\nCasey officers said business leaders had initially been interested until the trip was scheduled for the school holidays.\nThe City of Greater Dandenong is also investigating a trip to China.\nA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

         "Smooth Operators: It’s the lifties’ mountain, they just let us ride it\nby David Stillman Meyer\n\nMarch 2, 2017\nLiftie Lingo\nThe Maze: The lines that lead up to the lift\nThe Lobster Trap: The nylon barriers that prevent runway skiers/riders as well as too much snow piling up into the maze.\nBumping a Chair: When a lift operator holds the chair back for a more gentle seating. This is only needed on the 'fixed arm' lifts.\nDetachable versus Fixed Arm Lifts: Detachable 'high-speed quads' have arms that detach from the haul rope and are guided slowly through the loading zone by tires. After loading its passengers, the spring-loaded arm reattaches to the haul rope and away it goes. Fixed-arm lifts never leave the haul rope and travel at one speed round a bull wheel at which point it smacks the back of your legs … sometimes.\nPoma: A leading chair lift manufacturer located in the Alps in France who made a number of the Skico lifts.\nChair Marking: Marking a chair to the top attendant that may require extra attention unloading.\nThe Couch: A lift on the far east side of Aspen Mountain that is a quad but is not detachable and thus not high-speed. The long, slow, often sun-soaked ride earned its nickname, The Couch.\nD.T.: Deep Temerity chairlift. The definition of \"temerity\" is excessive confidence, audacity, so someone or something with \"deep temerity\" is ... insane?\nSafety Gate: If a passenger fails to unload, their legs will contact a lightweight bar, line, or pass through a light beam which stops the lift. The lift operator will then help them disembark, reset the safety gate, and initiate the lift restart procedure.\nNumbers versus Names: On Ajax and Snowmass, lifties reference lifts by their lift numbers; Buttermilk and Highlands by their names. (Old people on Ajax refer to them by number, as well.)\nWhile each mountain in the Aspen Skiing Co. family has its unique ascent, there is something suspenseful about the trip up Aspen Highlands. The vibe at the gate on Exhibition lift this particular morning is relaxed. It's warm and sunny and The Stones are playing softly in the background. Always a brisk ride up, one sails over the treetops at 1,000 feet per minute, or 11.36 mph. The lift dumps out above the Merry-Go-Round Restaurant and after a quick skier's-right dash around the corner, one arrives at the Loge Peak lift, nestled in a wooded glade. The song \"Good Vibes\" by Rebellion reverberates loudly, courtesy of an extra speaker perched in the trees. The lift operator is grooving to the beat and the heart rate ticks up as buttocks meet chair. It's quiet again, save for the wind and the intermittent rumble of the towers before the hum of the top terminal arrives. Castle Creek sprawls out in all her glory below; the ridge of the mighty Highland Bowl looms above. Eat your hearts out, O Red Mountain overlords, these top-of-the-lift, corner-office views can't be bought.\nWe're all so concerned with going down the mountain, we often don't give much pause to the ride up — and the curious long-haired creatures who make sure we get there safely. These are the lift operators and lift attendants — or \"lifties,\" to use mountain parlance — who supply an essential service to the resort. On one hand, you could take away the instructors, the restaurants, the ticket office, even the ski patrol, and technically people could still go skiing. But with no one to run the lifts, except for maybe a few uphillers, the mountains would be empty. On the other hand, what on Earth do the lifties do all day besides press a button and watch people sit and stand?\n\"We're the most seen, least visible people on the mountain,\" explains Jesse, an Aspen native who works/DJs the No. 3 Lift (aka Ajax Express). In short, a lot is going on before the first skier/rider arrives on the hill. \"The No. 1 thing about this job is safety,\" notes Buttermilk lift manager Marianne Barrett. Mandated by the Colorado Passenger Tramway Safety Board, each lift and gondola runs through a rigorous safety protocol each morning before the lifts can operate. This includes everything from testing the phones that connects the top and bottom terminals to checking the tires on the detachable high-speed quads and running various tests on the haul rope to make sure it is performing as it should be to making sure the chairs are moving through the zones efficiently so they don't pile up (not to mention monitoring the engine, its power supply, the auxiliary diesel engine, checking the emergency brakes, gears, pulleys, belts and every detail right down to panda bear protocol — or simply keeping track of the big stuffed panda on Buttermilk and making sure it rides the lift alone; only the smaller stuffed panda is allowed to ride with the kids up the chair).\nOnce the lifts are up and running, the main job is to make sure everyone gets on and off safely. The intensity of this duty varies from lift to lift.  V.X. (aka Village Express at the bottom of Snowmass) requires no less than 10 lifties at a time to load an endless stream of beginners, whereas Five Trees at Aspen Highlands, which services AVSC, can get as few as 10 riders total. Over on the Silver Queen Gondola, the lifties are busy making sure everyone gets in and out of the cabins safely and comfortably. Maneuvering guests' skies and boards in and out of those slots is an extra little amenity the lifties are happy to do.\n'We’re the most seen, least visible people on the mountian.'\n\"I mean, we have to one-up the service from those jerks at Vail,\" one such attendant confides shortly after handing the former first lady her skis.\nBut even on the most lackadaisical of lifts, attention must never waiver for more than a few seconds at a time. One never knows when something might go wrong. Tom, who works at the top of No. 4 (aka The Big Burn at Snowmass), recently had a little girl get her skis stuck. Her parents didn't realize what happened and so he ran out to help her. She was shaken and upset, but he quickly got her all settled, gave her the traditional \"everyone falls\" pep talk, and finished the deal with a fortuitous Valentine's Day lollipop he had tucked in his parka. \"She was so glad to see me,\" Tom explains. \"People don't realize how important customer service is to this job. You can't just be some silent dude in the background. It's really important to be able to get out there and make sure the guests feel safe and have a good time.\" Or as Marianne, Buttermilk's lift manager describes it, \"You have to be personable. You have to be friendly and you can't be afraid to touch people.\"\nApart from \"touching people,\" (appropriately, of course), the other defining challenge of being a lift operator is the cold. Luckily, Aspen gets a decent amount of sunshine; however, not all lifts get sun, and obviously, it gets damn cold plenty often. On a windy, cloudy day, just try standing out there with no skiing or boarding to get your blood going for eight minutes — much less eight hours — and you can start to imagine how insidious the plunging mercury can be. Put it this way, you will be dancing a gigue faster than you can hum, \"The snow is snowing. The wind is blowing.\"\nAnd then there is the boredom. Things do get slow, which leaves plenty of time to think.\n\"Yeah, sometimes too much time,\" laughs Maestro at the Deep Temerity lift. Rex, who works top of No. 9 (aka Sheer Bliss at Snowmass) reads the papers, does the crossword, sudoku, and then throws on a podcast — or four. Light reading and distractions are OK. Burying your nose in a page-turning novel, not OK. Outside, the attendants like to hit snow around, keeping busy with whatever they can — raking, shoveling, building steps.\n\"You start to master the three-second conversation,\" explains a different Tom, who works the Scooper Lift on Snowmass.\nAnother welcome distraction is something called \"chair marking.\" When someone is particularly nervous or had a rough embarkation, the bottom attendant will call up to the top to \"mark\" the chair. They also will mark particularly creative outfits — and particularly beautiful women.\n\"It's something to look forward to,\" blushes one top operator.\nFor some, it isn't the protocols, the cold, or the occasional boredom that gets to them, it is watching people ski all day. And this is the bittersweet — borderline sadomasochistic — aspect of the job: to be totally immersed, and yet once removed, from the sport that stirs their souls. You get paid to ski 100 days a year, but for most of those days, you are only getting a single run. One liftie admits that on powder days he won't even take it. \"It's just too painful to stop.\"\nThe powder day is example perfectus of the liftie paradox. What the rest of valley looks forward to with unbridled joy, the liftie anticipates with mixed feelings. \"We joke that you learn to hate powder days,\" explains Jesse on Ajax Express. \"But it's still nice to live vicariously.\" On Ajax, it's a 6:15 a.m. call time to help get all the gondola cabs back onto the haul line. They are removed at night during heavy snowfall so they don't get too weighed down. And then there are a good two hours of shoveling, raking, clearing out the maze (the lift lines), clearing out the lobster traps (the brightly colored gates that keep people from plowing into the crowd, as well as keeps the snow from piling up inside the maze.) Then again, a lot of the lifties get to enjoy a fresh track in the morning. At the very least, a nice ride down at the end of the day, not to mention the positive energy that reverberates from the mountainsides is an intoxicating and not altogether terrible work environment.\nPerhaps the most interesting aspect of the \"liftie life\" — as it were — is the unique culture that hatches every December at the base of the lifts. What used to be a bunch of ranchers and farmers who wanted to earn some extra money during the winter has evolved over the decades to become a calling in its own right, a sort of sub-subculture of the \"ski bum,\" a collection of mostly 20-something guys and a smattering of women who each imbue their lift or gondola with its own unique charms. The lifties at Summit Express at the base of Buttermilk work under their signature disco ball, loading 4-year-olds along with X Game acrobats who have just flung themselves into the air at similar launch vectors as the private jets 1,000 yards in the distance. Over on \"the Couch,\" one of the slowest rides around, the lifties enjoy its ample sunlight and en suite grill. Over at the Cloud Nine lift, famous for the DJing as much as the lift operating, it's always a joyous affair. The energy is amplified by Cloud Nine Restaurant patrons on their way to drink and dance with abandon.\nIf there is one leitmotif to the liftie culture — besides its fondess for long, Samson-esque locks and irreverent quotes scribbled on white boards — it is the music. It's something of a late-'80s, classic rock echo chamber, a proclivity for which I was unable to source any particular rhyme or reason. The music is selected by the lifties, whoever feels like plugging in their phone, with only slight management oversight (no heavy swearing, nothing too crass or aggressive.) The music is simply what they like to listen to.\n\"My playlists happen over time,\" explains Lewis, who claims \"Planet Earth\" as home and works the Loge lift. He is particularly passionate about his tunes. Planet Earth? \"Yeah, yeah I moved around a lot growing up, but I also like that it puts everyone on the same level.\" When asked if he includes much top 40 in his playlists he winces, \"Um … no.\" His go-to genres include reggae, classic rock, funk and a bit of disco. \"The music a) keeps me going, and b) makes the guests happy.\"\nPerhaps there is no better display of liftie culture than at Customer Appreciation Day, every Wednesday on Highlands. Guests enjoy free parking, free coffee, free muffins and then at high noon precisely, the lifties at Deep Temerity serve up 80 freshly grilled hot dogs to a crowd of ravenously appreciative guests. In the eight years it has been going, four minutes is the record for selling out. The Deep Temerity lift could very well be nicknamed \"The Locals' Lift.\" Servicing the Bowl and acres of gorgeous double-diamond terrain, it's no wonder it draws a certain devout fan base. Dave, an Aspen local who moved here in 1962, has been skiing \"D.T.\" seven days a week since it opened, usually eight to 12 runs a day, depending on how many bowl laps. When asked if he skies anywhere else, he responded with zero irony, \"Sure, I skied Snowmass once this season.\"\nAlmost all the lifts have their regulars and there is a certain family vibe that is created, not only among the lifties but between the guests, as well. One passes by in but a fleeting second, but somehow that little bond can form. Which isn't to say it's all peaches and cream in the liftie world. They spend all morning getting a lift open for a powder day and then get plenty of nasty looks when the snow hasn't been swiped off the chair. Not to mention that there's a hierarchy on the mountain and the lifties are pretty much at the bottom.\n\"They assume you're a pothead, a lazy ski bum, but a lot actually goes into this job that people don't see,\" one liftie confesses.\n\"It's the lowest paid but the most essential,\" argues Jason Leadman, a lift manager at Highlands.\nSo does a passing \"thank you\" lift their spirits?\n\"I never get sick of hearing the word thank you,\" Lewis replies, \"it's always a nice thing to hear.\"\nAside from gripes about pay and a respect gap, there is an overwhelming sense of pride, responsibility and joy among the liftie set.\n\"We work for a pretty badass company. The perks are small, but good,\" admits Tom on the Big Burn.\nHis friend Rex just over on Sheer Bliss makes the obvious comparison, \"I mean, the name says it all. Great view, great commute. It's very peaceful up here.\" Granted, at that exact moment it was a whiteout and the wind was howling, but you get the point. Spending time around the lifts, watching chair after chair after chair after chair roll by like waves crashing on a snowy beach, the hypnotic, almost spiritual nature of the job starts to emerge. Indeed, there is something monastic in the life of the liftie. Accepting the position isn't quite a vow of poverty, but not terribly far off. After all, it is a life committed if not to God, than to God's country, and all its pleasures be they ripped, fermented or smoked.\nIf there is a simple \"truth\" to the liftie life it was pointed out to me by Fernanda, who is on a J-1 visa from Costa Rica and works the Village Express at Snowmass. For all the hassles and hurdles of the ski vacation, and all the sacrifices of the ski life, it all melts away the moment you rush out in between the chairs. \"Everyone is happy when they are getting on the lift,\" she observes. And that, as they say, is the truth.\nDavid Stillman Meyer is a writer and graphic designer. Reach him at stillman-meyer.com.\nJoin the Conversation\n",

         "Experts raise doubts over benefit of new spillway at Hirakud Dam\nBy Express News Service   |  \n            Published:  02nd  March 2017 06:36 AM |\nLast Updated: 02nd  March 2017 06:36 AM | A+ A A- |\n0\nSAMBALPUR: Allocation of Rs 887 crore in the annual State budget for construction of an additional spillway in Hirakud dam has raised many eyebrows. This comes at a time when the State government is protesting the drastic reduction in inflow into Hirakud Dam Reservoir (HDR)  after Chhattisgarh Government constructed a series of barrages to harvest water.\nThe additional spillway at Hirakud dam was proposed after the Central Water Commission (CWC) recommended to enhance the flood water discharge capacity of all the major dams by 1.5 times of the current capacity.\nThe World Bank has even agreed to provide Rs 350 crore for the construction of the proposed spillway under the Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP).\nCurrently, there are 98 gates, including 64 sluice gates and 34 crest gates, to discharge flood water from the dam. The existing capacity to discharge the flood water from 98 gates is 15 lakh cusecs. However, it has been proposed to increase the flood water discharge capacity of the dam to 24 lakh cusecs which is why, the spillway has been proposed.\nWhile the team of Geological Survey of India (GSI) identified the location of spillway on the left dyke of the Hirakud dam, environmentalists doubt the additional spillway will be of any help.\nAccording to reports, the additional spillway is being constructed for release of flood waters from HDR. Water activist Ranjan Panda said that had the State Government planned long canals to divert water to irrigation fields or reservoirs built at a distance, it could have sold flood water to industries.\nRaising doubts over the government intention behind the spillway, Panda alleged that the State Government  is actually planning to help carry water to industries.\nHe said if the Government is serious about flood control, it should  invest in catchment protection, checking floodwaters and most importantly, increasing forest cover. \"When the State Government is unable to recover thousands of crores of water taxes and fines from defaulting industries, why should they go for World Bank loans to build such infrastructures whose impacts are doubtful,\" he questioned.\n",

         "MLAs using funds for beautification of parks: RWAs\n'Roads with potholes, dark spots, sewer system and rain drains warrant more attention'\nAnanya Panda\nTribune News Service\nNew Delhi March 1\nAlleging \"misuse\" of MLA Local Area Development (MLALAD) funds in the national Capital, Resident Welfare Associations have demanded a CBI probe into their spending by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators whom they have accused of pushing through \"wasteful\" projects in the name of beautification of parks, especially in posh colonies. Pointing out that there are areas, including roads with potholes, dark spots, sewer system and rain drains, which warrant much more attention than beautifying rich colonies they claimed most of the work is taken up as the financial year is nearing its end when the MLA funds (Rs 14 crore) if left unutilised will go waste. \"MLAs are rushing to finish their allotted Rs 14 crore each funds in unnecessary schemes and spending money in beautification of colony gates, putting up swings in rich colonies, expensive mast lights, duplicating things and putting 20 benches in small park,\" said VK Arora, convener, Delhi Residents Forum. \"Both ruling as well as opposition party MLAs are working as per their own whims, with the latter mostly appeasing the RSS dominated colonies and the former making their pockets happy,\" he alleged while adding that in all this RWAs are not kept in the loop – something that has left them disgruntled unlike during the Sheila Dikshit regime when \"bhagidari system\" allowed them some scope. \"Many are losing their playgrounds and other utility facilities due to unwanted installations and spending on things, like fixing of welcome boards, installation of mast lights at already lit areas, relaying of pavements already in good condition, putting too many benches in small parks, installing iron gates in narrow streets further narrowing entry,\" noted M M Mehra, another RWA member. Arora claimed that in East Delhi at the direction of BJP MLA O P Sharma in pavement of a park which was already in \"good condition\" was changed in Karan Vihar, a colony of 100 residents, more than 10 benches were installed in a park against wishes of colony children as installation of benches has ended their playground.\n",

         "Delhi\nPosted at: Mar 1, 2017, 12:26 AM; last updated: Mar 1, 2017, 10:57 AM (IST)\nCan’t muzzle dissent, say students\n\n NSUI members observe a one-day hunger strike against the Ramjas College row in Delhi Universitry. Tribune Photo: Mukesh Aggarwal\nAnanya Panda\nTribune News Service\nNew Delhi, February 28\nUp in arms against what they call ‘muzzling of dissent' and ‘ultra nationalism', students, alumni and teachers of Delhi University and JNU, among others, joined in large numbers the ‘Save DU' campaign called by Left-leaning student groups today. There were students from across the colleges of DU espousing the cause of the \"right to debate and dissent\" with many students arguing that the Ramjas College incident could have been an opportunity to question JNU student Umar Khalid, who is embroiled in a sedition case. \"It is (Ramjas violence and threats to Gurmehar) so scary. There is no point of having debates around democracy when there is so much intolerance. Universities have to have space for divergent views and violence is no way the answer differences in ideologies,\" said two students from Lady Shri Ram College. Losing civility is not the answer, said another protestor, even as she maintained that the fight should not be seen as one between two student factions but one against \"oppression and suppression of our right to disagree\". Another student, Kajal Bisht, who had come from South Campus, too blamed the ABVP for the entire Ramjas episode and said it must refrain from \"politics of muscle power\". Expressing solidarity to the cause, an alumna of both DU and JNU said \"The ultra nationalism that has started is horrifying. Such violence is not acceptable. What ABVP men are doing is not student politics but henchmen politics. Voices can't be throttled,\" she said. There were slogans, such as \"masculine politics not acceptable\", which echoed in the campus almost the entire day. However, the RSS-backed ABVP tried to distancing itself from the entire issue when it claimed the violence at DU's Ramjas College was provoked by \"outsiders\" whom it called \"anti-nationals\".\n",

         "Thursday, March 2, 2017\nM2M News\nChina Mobile and Ericsson delivers successful trial of world’s first cellular IoT-based connected factory\nAshish Sharma |  New Delhi |  02 Mar 2017\nChina Mobile and Ericsson share outcomes of its ongoing Connected Factory trial using Cellular IoT for Industry 4.0 working with Intel. The trial, featuring a connected screw driver among other tools, took place at Ericsson Panda Communication Company (a radio product manufacturing site and an independent subsidiary of Ericsson) in Nanjing. The outcomes of the trial are highlighted in a demonstration at Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona.\nSeveral low power, wide area (LPWA) use cases are currently being implemented in the factory, such as production line monitoring, warehouse monitoring and package and materials tracking. The centerpiece of the demonstration to be shown in Barcelona is the connected high-precision screwdriver, with motion sensors attached to NB-IoT modules that transmit real-time data of the tools to the Cellular IoT network.\nThe demonstration is an end-to-end solution, covering terminals, networks to the platform, and analytics aspects. The setup consists of Ericsson‘s multi-mode radio equipment with new software supporting NB-IoT, Intel's pre-commercial software supporting NB-IoT, the Intel XMM 7115 modem solution embedded in Fibocom's module, as well as China Mobile's OneNet IoT platform with its software development kit (SDK).\nThere are about 1000 high-precision screwdrivers in the factory which require routine calibrations and lubrications based upon the amount of usage, all of which are recorded manually on paper today. With Connected Screwdrivers, the factory will be able to replace manual tracking of the tool usage data with an automated solution. Also, by connecting the tools over the Cellular IoT network, intelligent analysis of the collected data allows for optimized maintenance. The resulting benefits include a longer lifespan of the tools and reduction of human errors during operations. Screwdrivers with motion sensors attached to NB-IoT modules means that the factory will be able to automate the usage tracking of the screwdrivers.\n\"The combination of Cellular IoT and Industry 4.0 has so far been fairly unexplored. Enabling IoT network technology such as Cellular LPWA, together with cloud-based solutions, give manufacturing firms access to more information than ever before. The opportunity to use data to increase productivity is not only beneficial to a firm, but the whole of society as well,\" said Chris Houghton, Head of Region North East Asia of Ericsson.\n\"Intel is a leading 3GPP Release 13 standardization contributor, developing a Release 13 Narrow Band IoT (i.g. CAT-NB1) based solution with the Intel XMM 7115 modem chipset. Intel will work with China Mobile and infrastructure companies to enable NB-IOT fast commercial deployment as we advance toward a 5G future,\" said Weng Kuan Tan, Vice President and General Manager of Intel's Client Computing Group China.\nChina Mobile is committed to accelerating the development of Cellular IoT technology and its ecosystem. On the one hand, China Mobile leads the incorporation and unification of NB-IoT standards by completing world's first lab testing on NB-IoT and making large-scale field trials and application exploration, in order to research   Cellular IoT networking schemes and facilitate fast maturation of end-to-end products; on the other hand, it originates the establishment of 5G Joint Innovation Center by uniting cross-industry and cross-region industry partners as well as international organizations, such as GTI and GSMA, builds open labs, makes business and  product innovation, promotes 5G networking cost reduction, and build dynamic, innovative, mutually beneficial and value sharing industry ecosystem.\n\"Ericsson is dedicated to helping operator customers around the world embrace the opportunities of IoT, 5G and Cloud. With our global leadership and experience in IoT standardization and applications, we will work hand in hand with China Mobile to realize the full potential of the Networked Society,\" added Chris Houghton.\n",

         "\n           \n\n           Video based social network HighlyRated com launches in Dubai\n           \n02, March 2017: HighlyRated.com, the region's first video -based social network, encouraging users to ‘Rate, Create and Participate' launched in Dubai earlier this week with its distinctive mascot Pablo the Panda. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Created by entrepreneurs, Acer Jamal and Stefan Cudby, HighlyRated features a variety of categories including everything from motor sports to singing. This allow users to upload and engage with video content based on their interest, while connecting with like-minded individuals both regionally and globally. \n\n Following the rapid rise in demand for online video content, the site was born when Acer and Stefan often found their friends posting videos of their passion, whether it be cycling or wakeboarding, on other social networks were met with a complete lack of interest. This led the pair to create HighlyRated.com, where users are encouraged to Rate or Hate videos based on their merit. Videos that are then the most ‘rated' will appear on the site's homepage, providing the user with higher visibility and connectivity. \n\n Commenting on HighlyRated.com's launch, Co-Founder and CEO Acer Jamal said, \"Beta testing of the site was beyond positive – even with very optimistic expectations, we're delighted with the response so far. Having lived in the UAE on & off for over 20 years, we chose to launch our Middle East office here in UAE due to its reputation as a hub for entrepreneurship. The Middle East is our focus before we expand outward, instead of the other way round, which has been the case with nearly every other social network.\" \n\n Users are now encouraged to sign up for the video-based social network by visiting www.HighlyRated.com . They can then immediately begin creating their own network by following the site's motto of Rate, Create and Participate. \n\n About HighlyRated.com: \n\n HighlyRated.com is a 100% privately owned video-based social media network founded by 2 dedicated entrepreneurs and features numerous categories that cover a multitude of interests. Users can Rate or Hate the video content & directly interact with each other. The site is dedicated to bringing people from all over the world together to share their experiences, passion and laughter – proving that our shared interests bring us together more than they set us apart. \n\n For Media Contact: \n Acer Jamal \n +971 50 301 4794 \n Acer@highlyrated.com\nby: Acer Jamal\n\n\n\n",

         "首页 > 营销 > 5 Tips to Crack Google’s Algorithm and Drive Quality Traffic To Your Site\n5 Tips to Crack Google’s Algorithm and Drive Quality Traffic To Your Site\n原文 http://www.jeffbullas.com/2017/03/02/5-tips-crack-googles-al\n2017-03-02 06:19:47 ℃ 0 评论\nLet’s face it…\nWith over 200+ Google ranking factors making sure the law of the land prevails, and over 1 billion websites fighting for spots in search engines – if you ignore SEO, your online sales are likely to go south, especially if you are unlucky enough to get struck with a Google penalty.\nIf you do not want to fall victim to a Google penalty, ensure that whenever the Google God’s wave their magic wand and whip up an algorithm update/change, such as Penguin, Pigeon, Panda, Hummingbird, or the recent RankBrain roll out, that you comply.\nBut then again, how do online website owners actually comply when Google reveals only so much?\nEven if you keep your nose pressed against Google’s conference room, you won’t get to know much.\nSo, how do you actually entice Google’s robots to drive more traffic to your website ?\nSimple. Play Along. Learn through trial and error. Stay on the learning curve. Perhaps then, you’ll be able to differentiate what works and what doesn’t.\nHowever, if you want a shortcut, check out these 5 tried and tested tips, which ensure that Google robots play along, no matter what.\n1. Build buyer personas, then nail them with your Naturaltongue\nNaturaltongue?\nUmm… folks, if there could be Parseltongue, why not Naturaltongue, huh?\nParseltongue for snakes. Naturaltongue for Google RankBrain AI. Simple.\nBut then, what’s this Buyer Persona?\nAh, yes! That calls for some explanation!\nAccording to the Content Marketing Insitute , content marketer’s build buyer persona’s by picturising their actual customers in terms of their age, job title, the company they are working for, the challenges and frustrations they are facing every single day, in addition to whether or not they are an authority decision maker.\nOnce you have a clearer picture on who your actual audience is, start communicating with them in your natural voice.\nBuilding a target audience, bearing in mind the buyer persona, helps businesses take the bull by the horns. Put simply, it helps address the problems of your target audience, more precisely. Makes sense… nah?\nTake, for instance, a site called wickedgoodies.com . The site has on display an amazing array of cake recipes, trade show tips, cake books on Amazon, video ebooks and so much more, all focussing on cakes, in addition to some great online marketing tips.\nLooking at the site, you’d realize the owner of this site knows their online visitors thoroughly – inside out, and has optimized their website accordingly.\nSo, when a customer, say someone called Suzanne, who runs a brick and mortar cake shop, is desperately looking for some tips to accelerate her online sales and Google’s ‘ Tips to promote cake online,’   she immediately stumbles on Wicked Goodies.\nHow come, you may ask?\nIt’s partly because Google’s RankBrain immediately figures out what Suzanne really wants and the RankBrain application intelligence robots rightly interpret ‘online’ as ‘internet’, and ‘tips’ as ‘strategies,’  thus returning high-quality results for Suzanne’s long tail search query.\nRankBrain AI is programmed to give better search results for complex and long-tail searches.\nNow, Suzanne could build on this info to make sure that her brick and mortar business not only survives but gives a tough competition to its competitors.\nKey takeways\nBuild a buyer persona and narrow down your target audience by sticking to it.\nFind what’s troubling your target audience, and then address those pain points in your natural language.\nUse related keywords (mind you, not the exact keywords). This could include synonyms, and co-occurrence (more on this in a minute) while offering solutions.\nCome up with creative blogs that immediately grab your user’s attention\nDesign products and services that address customer requirements\n2. Refer to Google’s crawl error report to spot gaps\nAs it turns out, for your site to feature in top searches, Google robots need to crawl your site, first and foremost.\nBut then, there are a few things to consider to ensure that Google doesn’t miss your site, in the first place.\nFirst off, make sure you are using accurate status codes on your site.\nFor example, use 301 redirects, instead of 302 redirects. Why you may ask? Well, because a 302 redirect is not at all programmed to inform Google robots that a particular page has been moved.\nAlso, consult Google’s crawl error report. The report keeps you covered in terms of gaps in your code, which perhaps is preventing Google robots from crawling your website properly.\nPlus, you can also block certain pages from being crawled using robots.txt. As you know, every site has a crawl budget and blocking images that are not that important, which ensures you have some spare budget in hand for really important pages.\nKey takeaway:\nUse 301 redirects, instead of 302 redirects\n",

         "Adelaide Zoo's giant panda Fu Ni. Photo: AP/Adelaide Zoo/Brian Charlton\nFu Ni underwent artificial insemination in October last year, and last week her hormone levels indicated she might have been preparing to give birth.\nBut the zoo says while she went through a 'pseudo-labour' over the weekend, including contractions and heavy breathing, the time has now passed for her to have delivered a baby.\nSenior panda keeper Simone Davey says her team had been treating Fu Ni as though she was pregnant but were never able to confirm a cub.\n'During a pseudo pregnancy, hormonal changes and behaviours are identical to those of a true pregnancy, making it very difficult to determine if a giant panda is actually pregnant or not,' she said.\n'The only definitive way to confirm pregnancy in pandas is through a comprehensive ultrasound examination where a foetus can be seen in the last few weeks of a pregnancy.\n'While Fu Ni has allowed us to ultrasound her for short periods, and the ultrasounds showed some swelling of the uterus and placenta thickening, we weren’t able to confirm a foetus.'\nSince going through the pseudo labour Fu Ni has adopted a toy and spends the day cradling and holding it close to her chest.\nDavey says such behaviour is expected and keepers will continue to monitor her closely and eventually help her to move on from the toy.\nZoos SA chief executive Elaine Bensted says despite the lack of success during the most recent breeding season, officials still have hopes that Fu Ni will become a mother at some stage.\n'We have always known that breeding the Southern Hemisphere’s only giant pandas was going to be incredibly challenging,' she said.\n– AAP\nJump to next article Will my comment be published?

         "Don't miss the latest stories\nAdvertise here\nPhotographer Personifies Depression In The Most Relatable Manner\nBy Hannah Sofea , 01 Mar 2017\n\n\nWith the awareness of mental illnesses rising, there is no better way to put it than the harmony of pictures that speak more than words can convey.\n\n\n Janelia Mould-Cheeky Ingelosi  is a South African photographer whose works are mainly focused on the wonders of her mind via conceptual photography. She incorporates both nature and realism in her artworks; consistently conveying strong messages through the ethereal beauty of these two concepts.\n\n\n‘Melancholy-a girl called depression' is no different. For those who have never experienced depression, it can be an obscure feeling of dejection, yet Ingelosi perfectly captivates it with her own personification of the condition. The character in the series comes without a head, and sans arms in a few of the photographs. It depicts the feeling of hopelessness and emptiness; having almost nothing left of her to go on-explaining the reason behind the character's legs remaining attached throughout the series.\n\n\nRegardless of the hike in awareness of mental illnesses, many who suffer from it would rather hide in its shadows than to have a voice for themselves. Ingelosi is hopeful her photo series will help as a stepping stone for those who are afraid to seek help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[via  Bored Panda , images via Cheeky Ingelosi Photography ]\nReceive interesting stories like this one in your inbox\nAdvertise here\n",

The levy is being introduced on soft drinks which are high in sugar in order to combat the rising obesity crisis.\nNichols will pay a final dividend of 20.3 pence, up from 17.6p in 2015, giving a full-year payout of 29.3p, up from 25.6p.\n\"The group has a clear strategy for growth and whilst the soft drinks market is likely to remain challenging in 2017, the board remains confident of delivering continued success underpinned by our strong brands, diversification and successful track record of profitable growth,\" Non-Executive Chairman John Nichols said in a statement.\nShares in Nichols were trading down 1.3% at 1,665.54p on Thursday.\nBy Karolina Kaminska; karolinakaminska@alliancenews.com; @KarolinaAllNews\nCopyright 2017 Alliance News Limited.

Tom Threadingham\nTHE Lockyer Valley's earthly wonders impressed onlookers at the annual Gatton Gem, Mineral and Fossil Show.\nThe local collection joined displays from more than 20 dealers from across south-east Queensland at the show on Saturday.\nFor the first time, a dinosaur bone display was also brought down from the Cobb and Co Toowoomba Museum for visitors to enjoy.\nGatton Lapidary Club president Leon Steinhardt said more than 400 people flowed through the doors for the event.\n\"They came from Northern NSW up to the Sunshine Coast and west of the Darling Downs,\" Mr Steinhardt said.\n\"Over half the people that came were from outside the Lockyer Valley region.\"\nAmong many highlights from the show, Mr Steinhardt said it was pleasing to see the younger generation getting involved.\n\"The interesting thing was we had quite a few people with young kids,\" he said.\n\"There was all these little kids that love rocks and we had heaps of them coming in.\"\nThe mega fauna and Queensland marine fossil displays were crowd favourites at the gem show, according to MrSteinhardt.\n\"They were very well received and the good thing about the museum section was that they could actually pick up those fossils,\" he said.\n\"They weren't the real thing but were replicas done on a 3D printer and the kids could pick them up and look at them.\"\nMr Steinhardt said the gem show also opened its doors to include an increased number of local craft and not-for-profit community groups compared to previous years.\n\"We do get a few comments from other gem clubs on the way that we do things because we are a little bit different,\" he said.\nPhotos\nView Photo Gallery\n",
